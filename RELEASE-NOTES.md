# Axom Software Release Notes

Notes describing significant changes in each Axom release are documented
in this file.

The format of this file is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

The Axom project release numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased] - Release date yyyy-mm-dd

### Added
- SLIC constructors added to streams that take in a `std::string`. If string is
  interpreted as a file name, the file is not opened until SLIC flushes and the
  stream has at least one message logged.
- Primal: Adds a `clip()` operator overload for clipping a 2D polygon against
  another 2D polygon.
- Primal: Adds `Polygon::reverseOrientation()` to reverse orientation of
  a polygon in-place.
- Adds `StaticArray`, a wrapper for `StackArray` with a size member variable.
- Multidimenional `core::Array` supports column-major and arbitrary stride ordering,
  in addition to the default row-major ordering.
- Adds new `PolygonArray` and `MAX_VERTS` template parameters to `primal::Polygon` for dynamic
  or static allocation.
- Adds support for the optional `caliper` and `adiak` dependencies to axom.
  These dependencies are added through axom's `spack` package via the new `+profiling` variant,
  and are enabled in axom's build system via the `CALIPER_DIR` and `ADIAK_DIR` configuration paths.
- Adds new annotation macros to axom: `AXOM_ANNOTATE_{BEGIN,END,SCOPE,METADATA}`. These replace
  the previous annotation macros `AXOM_PERF_MARK_{FUNCTION,SECTION}`.
- Adds a RAII-based `MPIWrapper` utility class to axom's core component. This can help setup/teardown
  MPI in axom's examples. It can also be used in configurations with MPI.
- Primal: Adds a `closest_point` operator for finding the closest point on a `Segment`
- Primal: Adds a `reflectPoint` method to the `Plane` primitive
- Primal: Makes several primitive methods available in device code
- Improves support for `axom::Array` allocated in unified and pinned memory on GPU platforms.
  Use of GPU-based operations for Arrays allocated in a unified memory space is controlled with
  a new method, `Array::setDevicePreference()`.
- Adds `svg2contours` script to convert paths in an SVG file to an MFEM NURBS mesh
- Quest: Adds an example to query winding numbers on an MFEM NURBS mesh

### Changed
- `axom::CLI::ExitCodes::Success` has been changed to `axom::CLI::ExitCodes::CLI11_Success`
  to avoid conflict when X11 `#define`s `Success`.
- `MarchingCubes` masking now uses the mask field's integer values instead of
  converting them to booleans.  The new behavior lets you select a value to mask for.
  If you want to continue the boolean behavior, use only 0 or 1 in your mask field.
- Primal: `Polyhedron::centroid()` function changed to return center of mass
  of the polyhedron. `Polyhedron::vertexMean()` added to return average of
  polyhedron's vertices. `Polyhedron::moments()` returns the volume and centroid
  of the polyhedron, the 0th and 1st moments respectively.
- `quest::ArrayIndexer` is now `axom::MDMapping`, adopting conventional terminology
  and moving out of `quest`.
- `mint::structured_exec` is now `axom::nested_for_exec`, to support nested for loops
  for all of Axom.  See `src/axom/core/execution/nested_for_exec.hpp`.
- Set default Umpire allocator id to device instead of unified for CUDA and HIP execution policies.
- Upgrades `vcpkg` usage for axom's automated Windows builds to its
  [2024.03.19 release](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2024.03.19).
  Also updates vcpkg port versions for axom dependencies. Temporarily removes `umpire`
  from axom's default dependencies on Windows due to incompatibility between umpire's
  external `fmt` and axom's vendored copy.
- Turn off CMake finding dependencies on system paths.
- `axom::Array`: trivially-copyable types with a non-trivial constructor are now initialized on the GPU.
- SLIC no longer outputs the rank count in the `RANK` format string in parallel loggers. You can access
  the rank count via new format option `RANK_COUNT`.

### Removed
- Removes config option `AXOM_ENABLE_ANNOTATIONS`. Annotations are now provided by `caliper` 
  (and `adiak` for metadata) and are available when axom is configured with `CALIPER_DIR` and `ADIAK_DIR` 
  config variables.
- Removes caching of `{PACKAGE}_FOUND` variables in `SetupAxomThirdParty.cmake`

## [Version 0.9.0] - Release date 2024-03-19

### Added
- Primal: Adds a `Quadrilateral` primitive
- Primal: Adds a `compute_bounding_box()` operator for computing the bounding
  box of a `Quadrilateral`
- Primal: Adds a `clip()` operator for clipping a tetrahedron against the
  half-space defined by a plane
- Primal: Adds a `checkAndFixOrientation()` function to `primal::Tetrahedron`
  that swaps the order of vertices if the signed volume of the Tetrahedron is
  negative, resulting in the signed volume becoming positive.
- Adds `FlatMap`, a generic key-value store which aims for drop-in compatibility
  with `std::unordered_map`, but utilizes an open-addressing design.
- Adds support for device-side use of `Array::push_back()` and `Array::emplace_back()`.
- Adds initial support for using Slic streams with tags
- Adds an example that finds intersection candidate pairs between two Silo
  hexahedral meshes using either a BVH or Implicit Grid spatial index
- Quest: Adds `setTetPredFromBoundingBox()` and `setTetPred()` functions to
  `quest::ProEReader` and `PProEReader` that set a tet predicate, allowing
  user code to read in a subset of a Pro/E ASCII tetrahedron mesh file.

### Changed
- `MarchingCubes` has optimizations to improve GPU performance, particularly for
  repeated computations.  The constructor has changed and a new `setMesh` method
  is added to set (or change) the mesh.  New accessors present output data
  without moving them from device to host.  These accessors are an interim
  solution and likely to be updated in the future.
- `DistributedClosestPoint` outputs are now controlled by the `setOutput` method.
- `MarchingCubes` allows user to select the underlying data-parallel implementation
  - `fullParallel` works best on GPUs.
  - `hybridParallel` reduces the amount of data processed and works best with
     `MarchingCubesRuntimePolicy::seq`.
  - `byPolicy` (the default) selects the implementation based on the runtime policy.
- `MarchingCubes` and `DistributedClosestPoint` classes identify domains by their
  `state/domain_id` parameters if provided, or the local iteration index if not.
- `MarchingCubes` and `DistributedClosestPoint` classes changed from requiring the Blueprint
  coordset name to requiring the Blueprint topology name.  The changed interface methods are:
  - `DistributedClosestPoint::setObjectMesh`
  - `DistributedClosestPoint::computeClosestPoints`
  - `MarchingCubes::MarchingCubes`
  - `MarchingCubesSingleDomain::MarchingCubesSingleDomain`
- Primal: `Polyhedron::volume()` function changed from returning a signed
  volume to an unsigned volume. The added `Polyhedron::signedVolume()` function
  returns the signed volume.
- Primal: `intersection_volume()` operators changed from returning a signed
  volume to an unsigned volume.
- Primal's `BoundingBox::contains(BoundingBox)`  now returns `true` when the input is empty
- Renamed axom's bit utility functions to conform to `C++20` standard: `popCount() -> popcount()`, 
  `trailingZeros() -> countr_zero()` and `leadingZeros() -> countl_zero()`
- Renamed `axom::utilities::swapEndian() -> byteswap()` to conform to `C++23` standard

### Fixed
- quest's `SamplingShaper` now properly handles material names containing underscores
- quest's `SamplingShaper` can now be used with an mfem that is configured for (GPU) devices
- primal's `Polygon` area computation in 3D previously only worked when the polygon was aligned with the XY-plane. It now works for arbitrary polygons.
- Upgrades our `vcpkg` usage for automated Windows builds of our TPLs to its [2023.12.12 release](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2023.12.12)
- Fixed a bug in the bounds checks for `primal::clip(Triangle, BoundingBox)`
- Fixed a bug when loading Sidre groups with attributes that already exist
- Fixed `std::locale` error when when compiling `src/axom/core/utilities/System.cpp` using nvcc
- Include `cstdint` for higher gcc version support (e.g. gcc-13)
- Fixed several memory leaks in `axom::Array`, `quest::Shaping` and `sidre::MFEMSidreDataCollection`

## [Version 0.8.1] - Release date 2023-08-16

- Updates to [camp version 2023.06.0][https://github.com/LLNL/camp/releases/tag/v2023.06.0]
- Updates to [Umpire version 2023.06.0][https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire/releases/tag/v2023.06.0]

### Fixed

- Various fixes to CMake machinery

## [Version 0.8.0] - Release date 2023-07-26

### Added
- Adds MarchingCubes class implementing the marching cubes algorithm for surface detection.
- Adds the following methods to `axom::Array` to conform more closely with the `std::vector` interface:
  - `Array::front()`: returns a reference to the first element
  - `Array::back()`: returns a reference to the last element
  - `Array::resize(size, T value)`: resizes the array, and sets any new elements to `value`.
- Adds an `ArrayView::empty()` method to return whether the view is empty or not.
- Adds an `area()` function to `primal::Polygon`
- Adds initial support for using Slam types on the GPU
- Adds support for using `ArrayViewIndirection` indirection policy with `slam::Map` and
  `slam::BivariateMap`
- Adds `const_iterator` support to `slam::BivariateMap` and `slam::SubMap`
- Primal: Adds a `Hexahedron` primitive
- Primal: Adds a `clip()` operator for computing the intersection of a
  `Hexahedron` and another `Tetrahedron` as a `Polyhedron`
- Primal: Adds an `intersection_volume()` operator for computing the volume of
  intersection between a primitive and a `Tetrahedron`
- Primal: Adds a `primal::Polyhedron::from_primitive()` operator that returns a
  `Polyhedron` object from a given primitive.
- Adds `DataStore::getBufferInfo()` and `Group::getDataInfo()` methods that insert information into a Conduit `Node` about buffers in a `DataStore` object or data in a `Group` subtree. The information can be accessed from the `Node` by the caller from specifically named fields in the `Node`.
- Quest: Adds a `quest::ProEReader` for reading in Pro/E tetrahedral meshes
- Quest: The `quest::IntersectionShaper` class can now use a percent error to determine
  whether the revolved volume for a shape is sufficiently accurate or whether the shape
  must be further refined. This new dynamic method of shaping complements the existing
  segment-based curve refinement method and it is activated using `Shaper::setRefinementType()`
  and by calling `Shaper::setPercentError()` to set a refinement error percentage.
- Multimat: adds initial support for fields stored on the GPU. `MultiMat::setAllocatorID()`
  or `MultiMat::setFieldAllocatorID()` can be called to change the memory space in which a
  field is allocated.
- Multimat: adds an `MultiMat::addExternalField()` function to support fields where the
  memory is managed externally. Fields which are externally-managed cannot be transposed
  between sparse and dense layouts, or moved between allocator spaces.
- Multimat: adds a `MultiMat::removeField()` function to remove fields from the Multimat
  instance.
- Multimat: adds an overload of `MultiMat::setCellMatRel()` that supports setting a
  multi-material relation in a compressed sparse-row (CSR) representation.
- Quest: Adds ability to import volume fractions into `SamplingShaper` before processing `Klee` input
- Slam: adds a `slam::MappedVariableCardinality` policy to accelerate mapping flat indices
  back to first-set indices when used in a `StaticRelation`
- Adds an `ArrayView(data, shape, strides)` constructor to support column-major and custom
  striding layouts.
- Adds an `ArrayView::subspan()` overload for multi-dimensional subspans
- Adds an `axom::utilities::insertionSort()` method.
- Quest: Adds Pro/E tetrahedral meshes as input to the `IntersectionShaper`
- Quest: For sample-based shaping, users can register callback functions to modify the input points
  before querying the spatial index. This allows, e.g. querying 3D points against 2D surfaces
  of revolution provided as c2c contour files.
- Adds an ``axom::utilities::locale`` utility function to guard against platforms that do not have the requested 
  locales via the `std::locale` function. If the system does not have the requested locale (e.g. `en_US.UTF8`),
  it returns the user's default locale.
- Sidre: Add new protocols `sidre_layout_json` and `conduit_layout_json` to provide output of DataStore layout in a user-readable format that excludes the numerical arrays held by Views and Buffers.
- Sidre: Add methods to methods for destroying Groups that will also destroy Buffers if the destruction of a Group and the Views in its subtree cause the Buffer to become detached from all Views.
- Sidre: Add two Group methods -- one to return a vector of the valid I/O protocols (based on compilation options), and one that returns a default protocol. 
- Klee: Add support in shaping driver and MFEMSidreDataCollection to write Blueprint datasets that contain matset metadata needed for VisIt to treat volume fraction arrays as a material. This enables VisIt plots such as FilledBoundary.

### Changed
- Fixed bug in `mint::mesh::UnstructuredMesh` constructors, affecting capacity.
  A missing factor was added.  If you worked around this by adding the factor yourself,
  you may want to undo that work-around.
- Updates blt submodule to blt@0.5.3
- Updates uberenv submodule to HEAD of main on 12May2023
- Updates to [conduit version 0.8.6](https://github.com/LLNL/conduit/compare/v0.8.3...v0.8.6)
- Updates to [mfem version 4.5](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/releases/tag/v4.5)
- Updates to [fmt version 9.1.0](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/releases/tag/9.1.0)
- Updates to `c2c` version 1.8.0
- The Axom library has been broken down into its component libraries (prefixed with `axom_`).
  This change requires no change to downstream CMake users who import our targets.
  The exported CMake target `axom` includes all components, but users who do not import our targets
  will need to create the link line themselves. The following replacement can be used:
  `-laxom` -> `-laxom_quest -laxom_multimat -laxom_slam -laxom_mint -laxom_klee -laxom_inlet -laxom_sidre -laxom_slic -laxom_lumberjack -laxom_core`
  If you only need a subset of the components, you can now use those targets directly, ie. `axom::inlet`.
- `IntersectionShaper` now implements material replacement rules.
- `axom::Array` move constructors are now `noexcept`.
- Exported CMake targets, `cli11`, `fmt`, `sol`, and `sparsehash`, have been prefixed with `axom::`
  to guard against conflicts.
- `DistributedClosestPoint` query now supports any blueprint-valid mesh format, including multidomain.
   Domain underloading and overloading can be expressed using multidomain format.  Closest points are
   identified by cp_rank, cp_domain_index, and cp_index.  The new cp_domain_index specifies the
   domain containing the closest point.
- `DistributedClosestPoint` interfacing variable names `closest_point` and `min_distance` have been
  changed to `cp_coords` and `cp_distance`, respectively, to match the naming convention of other
  interfacing variables.
- Adds `vcpkg` ports for `RAJA`, `Umpire` with optional `OpenMP` feature for automated Windows build
- Reduce size of `ArrayView::subspan` to prevent accessing invalid memory.
- Adds `vcpkg` port for `lua` as optional dependency on Windows
- Adds additional parameters to quest's `PointInCell` query to control the Newton solve
  from physical to reference space for a given element
- Remove function pointer call in IteratorBase::advance()
- Slam: `IndirectionPolicy::data()` now returns a reference to the underlying buffer
  Rebinding an indirection to a new buffer is now achieved through `IndirectionPolicy::ptr()`, which
  returns a mutable pointer to the buffer.
- Quest: `Shaper::applyTransforms()` is no longer a public method.
- Multimat: fields are now returned as shallow, device-copyable views of a field instead
  of full copies of field data.
- Multimat: `MultiMat::addField()` and `MultiMat::setVolfracField()` API now use `axom::ArrayView`
  to accept data.
- Multimat: Ported field data/sparsity layout conversion methods to GPU.
- Multimat: `MultiMat::makeOtherRelation()` now runs on the GPU with an appropriately-set allocator ID.
- Multimat: `MultiMat::setCellMatRel(counts, indices)` now runs on the GPU, and accepts GPU-side data.
- Renames `ArrayView::spacing()` to `ArrayView::minStride()`.
- Klee: A shape's geometry no longer needs a `path` field when its `format` is "none"
- Quest: Shapes without geometry can participate in replacement rules for sample-based shaping. Volume
fractions for the associated materials must be supplied before shaping.
- Primal: Expose Polyhedron::getFaces() as public method.
- Removed custom Spack package recipes in favor of using the radiuss-spack-configs repository as a submodule.

###  Fixed
- Fixed issues with CUDA build in CMake versions 3.14.5 and above. Now require CMake 3.18+
  for CUDA/non-gpu builds.
- Fix to allow Axom to build when using RAJA, but not Umpire.
- Checks validity of bounding boxes in `primal`'s intersection operators against planes
  and triangles before using the geometry.
- Improves import logic for `lua` dependency
- Improves import logic for `mfem` dependency in device builds when `mfem` is configured with `caliper`
- Fixes ambiguity when calling `Array::resize(size, value)` for `Array<bool>`
- Sidre: Group methods `hasChildView()` and `hasChildGroup()` changed to return false when Group holds items in list format. This fixes an IOManager issue causing failures for multi-domain meshes when writing Blueprint index file.
- Sidre: Changed Group::copyToConduitNode() method to properly handle Groups using the list format. Previously, it was assumed that all child items in a Group have a name, which is not the case for list format.
- Sidre: Fixed Group method `importConduitTreeExternal()` to handle lists with unnamed members the same as `importConduitTree()`.
- Slic and Lumberjack: Add missing calls to `flush()` for parallel output log streams.

### Deprecated
- Integer types in `src/axom/core/Types.hpp` are deprecated because `c++11` supports their equivalents.


## [Version 0.7.0] - Release date 2022-08-30

###  Added
- Adds a `view()` method to `axom::Array` class to simplify creation of a corresponding `axom::ArrayView`
- Adds GPU/OpenMP support to `spin::ImplicitGrid`.
  The following functions run with the user-specified execution space (specified as a template argument
  on `ImplicitGrid`):
  - `ImplicitGrid::insert(nelems, bboxes)`: insert a batch of bounding boxes into the implicit grid
  - `ImplicitGrid::getCandidatesAsArray(nquery, queryObjs, ...)`: query the implicit grid for a batch of
    query objects, and generate a CSR-format array for the candidates.
  In addition, `ImplicitGrid::getQueryObject()` returns an object that may be used within a GPU kernel
  to query the implicit grid.
- Added initial implementation of GPU/OpenMP-accelerated point-in-cell queries
- Added an alternative surface mesh tester function to Quest, based on `ImplicitGrid`
- Add `const` versions of `begin()` and `end()` for `Array` and `ArrayView`
- Add support for passing compatible custom allocator IDs to `axom::Array` with explicitly specified
  memory space
- Adds constructor overloads to `axom::Array` that uses both uninitialized data (`ArrayOptions::Uninitialized`)
  and custom allocators
- Adds a comparison operator (`operator<()`) to `StackArray`. This allows it to be used as a key for `std::map`
- Use compiler intrinsics for axom's bit utility functions: `popCount()`, `trailingZeros()` and `leadingZeros()`
- Adds a random-access iterator to `slam::DynamicSet`
- Adds an overload to `ImpicitGrid::getCandidates()` from a grid cell of the lattice.
  This makes it easier to iterate over the bins of the spatial index.
- Defines iterator traits on `axom::Array<T>`/`ArrayView<T>` iterators, to allow passing iterator
  pairs to standard library functions
- Adds full support for calling methods on `axom::Array<T>` allocated in device-only memory.
- Adds ability to index into subarrays of a multidimensional `axom::Array<T>` using
  `operator[]` and `operator()`
- Adds ability to build axom using the `hip` compiler. Support for running device
  kernels with hip will be added in the future.
- Adds new host-configs for HIP on LLNL platforms
- Adds GPU/OpenMP support to `spin::UniformGrid`.
  The following functions run with a user-specified execution space (specified as a template argument
  on `UniformGrid`):
  - `UniformGrid::initialize()`: creates/re-creates a uniform grid with an array of objects and their
    corresponding bounding boxes
  - `UniformGrid::getCandidatesAsArray()`: query the uniform grid for objects that share a grid
    cell with the query bounding box
  In addition, `UniformGrid::getQueryObject()` returns an object that may be used within a GPU kernel
  to query the uniform grid.
- Adds ability to specify a storage policy in `UniformGrid`. Two policies are provided:
  - `DynamicGridStorage` stores the bins as an array of arrays (default)
  - `FlatGridStorage` stores the bins as a flat array of elements, where each bin is a slice of the
    array
- Adds a templated uniform grid-based surface mesh tester function to Quest
- Adds an initializer list constructor and assignment operator to `axom::Array`
- Adds an overload of `axom::Array::resize(ArrayOptions::Uninitialized, dims)` to support resizes
  without constructing or initializing new elements
- Adds examples and tests for using Slic interface in Fortran
- Adds examples for using the BVH device traversal API
- Adds a `ScatteredInterpolation` query to quest, which enables interpolating scalar fields at arbitrary
  points from a given 2D or 3D point mesh in the Mesh Blueprint format. The current implementation
  generates a Deluanay complex over the points and performs linear interpolation over the
  triangle/tetrahedron at the query points.
- Adds a HIP execution policy for device kernels to run on AMD GPU hardware
- Adds new Slic macros that allow you to selectively print messages only on root ranks. For example,
  `SLIC_ERROR_ROOT(msg)` and `SLIC_ERROR_ROOT_IF(EXP, msg)`. This can be set via
  `slic::initialize(bool is_root = true)` or `slic::setIsRoot()`.
- Adds forward iterators to the `View`s and `Group`s of a `sidre::Group`.
  These can be accessed via the range-for syntax as `for(auto& view: grp.views()){...}`,
  Or using the iterator syntax as
  `for(auto& it = grp.views().begin(), itEnd = grp.views().end(); it ! itEnd ; ++it) {...}`, and similarly for the groups of a group.
- Adds forward iterators to the `Attribute`s and `Buffers`s of a `sidre::DataStore`,
  with a similar syntax, e.g. `for(auto& buf : datastore.buffers()){...}`.
- Adds an overload of `ImplicitGrid::getCandidatesAsArray()` to accept query points/bounding boxes
  as an `axom::ArrayView`.
- Adds a `primal::closest_point(point,sphere)` overload to find the closest point on a sphere to a given point
- Adds an overload to quest's `SignedDistance` query to return the closest point on the surface
  to the query point and the surface normal at that point. Also exposes this functionality
  in quest's signed_distance C API.
- Adds utility function for linear interpolation (`lerp`) of two numbers
- Adds utility function to compute binomial coefficients
- Adds a `CurvedPolygon` class to primal representing a polygon with `BezierCurve`s as edges
- Adds functions to compute the moments (area, centroid) of a `CurvedPolygon`
- Adds functions to evaluate integrals over `BezierCurve` and `CurvedPolygon` objects
- Adds a `ArrayViewIndirection` storage policy to Slam
- Adds set accessor methods to `slam::DynamicVariableRelation`
- Adds a new component to Axom, `multimat`, to simplify the handing of multi-material meshes and
  fields.
- Adds functions to compute winding numbers and in/out queries for `Polygon` and `CurvedPolygon` objects.
- Adds `constants.hpp` to primal to track geometric constants. Initially includes
  a value for `PRIMAL_TINY`, a small constant that can be added to
  denominators to avoid division by zero.
- `DistributedClosestPoint` query now supports "domain underloading" -- ranks that are passed in can
  have empty object meshes and/or empty query meshes
- 'BezierCurve' objects now support Rational Bezier curve functionality
- Primal: Adds a `clip()` operator for computing the intersection of a `Tetrahedron` and another `Tetrahedron` as a `Polyhedron`
- Added `slic::outputLocalMessages()` to output messages from the current rank to the console for MPI-enabled LogStreams.

###  Changed
- Axom now requires C++14 and will default to that if not specified via `BLT_CXX_STD`.
- Moved bit-twiddling functions to core component
- `axom::Array` now default-initializes its data by default. To create an Array with uninitialized
  elements, pass an `axom::ArrayOptions::Uninitialized` as the first constructor argument.
- `axom::ArrayView<const T>` can now be created from a `const Array<T>`
- Added new `ExecSpace` template parameter to `spin::ImplicitGrid`.
  `ExecSpace` is now the second template parameter (out of three) and defaults to `axom::SEQ_EXEC`.
- Instead of saving the entire `DataStore`, `MFEMSidreDataCollection` will now save only
  its domain and global groups
- When an `inlet::Field` fails a range or valid value constraint, the provided value and
  corresponding range/set of valid values are now included in the error message
- IOManager::write now allows the calling code to pass in the full name of
  the root file that it will produce
- Improved consistency of orientation operations in `primal::Plane`, `primal::Sphere`, `primal::orientation()`
  and `primal::in_sphere()`
- Improved efficiency for `primal::in_sphere()` -- the computations are now based on `(D+1)x(D+1)` determinants
  instead of `(D+2)x(D+2)` determinants for `D`-dimensional spheres
- Improved efficiency for (signed) area/volume functions of `primal::Segment`, `primal::Triangle` and `primal::Tetrahedron`
- Updates interface for `primal::Sphere` to use more of `primal`, e.g. uses `primal::Point` instead of `T*` to represent points
- Adds `circumsphere()` functions to `primal::Triangle` and `primal::Tetrahedron` to return the `Sphere`
  that circumscribes the triangle/tetrahedron's vertices
- Adds operator overloads to subtract a `primal::Vector` from a `primal::Point` to yield a new `primal::Point`
- Consolidates `quest::findTriMeshIntersections*()` implementations for `BVH` and `ImplicitGrid`
- `BVH::find*()` batch functions now return the total number of candidate intersections found
- Enables empty `axom::Array<T>` to be iterated over with `begin()/end()`
- Removed `AXOM_VERSION_EXTRA` in favor of `axom::gitSHA()` and adding the SHA to `axom::getVersion()` and
  `axom::about()`
- Use more specific type trait checks in `ArrayOps`, to avoid generating unnecessary copies in
  fill/destroy operations on otherwise trivially-copyable/destructible types.
- `axom::Array` now consistently propagates the allocator ID on copy, move, and swap operations when possible.
  This is a breaking change; copy-construction of a dynamic array from a device array will no longer automatically
  move the array to host memory, and will instead maintain the same allocator ID as the source array.
- The device traversal method `BVH::TraverserType::traverse_tree()` now supports passing in arbitrary query objects
  for BVH traversal.
- Moved `inlet::LuaReader::solState()` to be a protected function that now returns a `std::shared_ptr<axom::sol::state>`.
  This is an advanced feature that could cause users to break an input file state after verification. This also allows us
  to not expose `axom/sol.hpp` to all users of Inlet. This greatly reduces compile times. Using this feature requires
  both a derived class and including `axom/sol.hpp` in the user code.
- Renamed some overloads of function `createView` of
  `axom::sidre::Group` which accept `int ndims, IndexType *shape`
  arguments to be `createViewWithShape` or `createViewWithShapeAndAllocate`.
- Replaced an unused older incarnation of iterators in sidre with a new `std`-compliant
  implementation
- Removed an out-of-date manually-generated header file in sidre `sidre/core/sidre.hpp`.
  We recommend using the automatically generated header file `axom/sidre.hpp` to include
  sidre functionality.
- Removed functions from `sidre::ItemCollection` base class that were not common to all derived classes
  and added a new derived class `sidre::IndexedCollection`
- Spin: `BVH::findPoints/Rays/BoundingBoxes()` candidate search methods now accept an `axom::ArrayView<IndexType>`
  for the `offsets` and `counts` output arrays, and return `candidates` as an `axom::Array<IndexType>`.
- Renamed `primal::Polygon::centroid()` to `primal::Polygon::vertexMean()` because it was not actually computing the centroid.
- `axom:sidre:IndexType` is now the same type as
  `axom:IndexType`. Before, Sidre always used `int64_t`. Now it
  respects the define `AXOM_USE_64BIT_INDEXTYPE`.
- Mint now depends on the Slam component.
- Renames indirection policies in slam: The c-array indirection policy was renamed from `ArrayIndirection` to `CArrayIndirection`
  and the axom::Array-based indirection policy was renamed from `CoreArrayIndirection` to `ArrayIndirection`.
- Mfem dependency updated to 4.4
- `primal::detail::intersect_ray` now correctly identifies intersections between collinear `Segment` and `Ray` objects.
- Improved efficiency and robustness of barycentric coordinate
  and circumsphere computation for Triangles and Tetrahedra.

###  Fixed
- Fixed a bug relating to swap and assignment operations for multidimensional `axom::Array`s
- Fixed over-eager caching of restored `mfem::FiniteElementSpaces` in `sidre::MFEMSidreDataCollection`
- Fixed a bug in which Inlet verification bails out on the first failure, which resulted in
  incomplete error lists
- Fixed a bug in `quest::PointInCell` when not using RAJA
- Fixed a potential memory leak in `axom::Array<T>` for non-trivial types `T` which allocate memory
- Added a guard in `axom::ArrayList` for axom configurations without Umpire to fix a compiler error (XL compiler)
- Inlined some fully specialized functions in `quest::Delaunay` to avoid "multiply-defined" linker errors
- Fixed `axom::Array<T>` fill operations on uninitialized memory
- Fixed behavior of `axom::Array<T>::resize(new_size)` with `new_size < curr_size`
- Fixed computation of signs in `quest::SignedDistance` when closest point is along an edge
  with a sharp dihedral angle and the adjacent triangles have significantly different areas
- Fixed bug in axom::Path that ignored the leading delimiter character if one was present
- Fixed gcc compiler errors in configurations without RAJA or Umpire
- Fixed `axom::Array<T>` behavior on copy-construction when `T` is a non-trivial type
- Replaced `using` statement in `SidreDataTypesIds.h` with `typedef`
  since C syntax is required in this file.
- Fixed bug on two-dimensional `sidre::Array<T>` construction where the size is set to the underlying buffer
  capacity, instead of the actual number of elements
- Fixed `axom::Array<T>::insert` behavior with non-trivial types.
- Fixed bug in Slic macros for MPI-based LogStreams not aborting when using collective Error or Warning
  macros

## [Version 0.6.1] - Release date 2021-11-17

###  Added
- Added a config variable, `AXOM_DEBUG_DEFINE` to control whether the `AXOM_DEBUG` compiler define is enabled.
  By `DEFAULT`, it is enabled for `Debug` and `RelWithDebInfo` configurations, but this can be overriden
  by setting `AXOM_DEBUG_DEFINE` to `ON` or `OFF`.
- `axom::Array` is now GPU-compatible, in particular via a memory space template parameter and via
  extensions to `axom::ArrayView` that allow for copying into kernels and transfers between memory spaces.
- Adds some utility arithmetic operators for adding and subracting `primal::Point`s and `primal::Vector`s

###  Changed
- Renamed `AXOM_NOT_USED` macro to `AXOM_UNUSED_PARAM` for better consistency with other Axom macros
- Added `explicit` to `axom::Inlet::InletVector` constructors and added a constructor that accepts a `double*`
- `AXOM_ENABLE_MFEM_SIDRE_DATACOLLECTION` configuration option is now `ON` by default (rather than `OFF`).
  This option should be disabled if `mfem` was configured with `MFEM_USE_SIDRE`.

###  Fixed
- The `AXOM_DEBUG` compiler define is now properly exported via the `axom` CMake target when it is enabled
- Added tolerance parameter `EPS` to `primal::closest_point()` operator. This effectively snaps
  closest points to the triangle boundaries vertices and edges when they are within `EPS`,
  improving consistency when, e.g., querying multiple triangles from the same mesh.
- Fixed regression in `SignedDistance` queries for query points closest to edges or vertices
  of the input triangle mesh
- Guard fmt's compiler defines from clashing with downstream fmt's.


## [Version 0.6.0] - Release date 2021-11-04

### Added
- Added new CMake option to allow users to turn off Axom created tools: `AXOM_ENABLE_TOOLS`
- Inlet can now log verification errors to a user-processable list instead of using Slic
- Sidre parallel I/O: Added new mapping arrays to the automatically-generated Blueprint
  index to support new schema for multi-domain parallel meshes.
- Added support for optional third-party `c2c` ("contours to codes") library for parsing 2D spline data.
  `c2c` is currently only available for Axom configurations on LLNL platforms.
- Primal's `intersect(Ray, Segment)` can now return the parametric coordinates of the intersection
  along both the ray and the segment (when the intersection exists)
- Primal's `intersect(Segment, BoundingBox)` can now return the parametric coordinates bounding the
  portion of the segment contained within the BoundingBox (when the intersection exists)
- Generalizes Quest's `InOutOctree` class to work with 2D line segment meshes. Previously,
  it only worked with 3D triangle meshes
- Added support for reading `c2c` ".contour" files in Quest. Contours that enclose a 2D region can be linearized
  into line segment meshes and loaded into Quest's `InOutOctree` for in/out queries.
- Updated the Quest `inout` C API to support 2D queries using the `c2c` library, when Axom is configured with `c2c`
- Updated the C++ Quest "containment" example to support 2D in/out queries
  (in addition to the already supported 3D queries)
- Added `axom::Array` modeled after `std::vector`. Previous `axom::Array` renamed to `axom::MCArray`. Future changes to both arrays are expected.
- Added a `data_collection_util` tool to generate Mesh Blueprint compliant high order distributed meshes from
  an mfem mesh or over a Cartesian domain
- Added utility functions `axom::utilities::getHostName()` and `axom::utilities::getUserName()`.
- Added new `axom::primal::ZipIterable<T>` type to convert structure-of-arrays data to a given
  Primal geometric primitive.
- Quest: Added a `computeDistances()` function to `SignedDistance` class for batched
  signed-distance queries.
- Spin: Added a `getTraverser()` function to `BVH`, enabling the customized traversal of a
  BVH from within a device kernel.
- Primal: Adds an `Octahedron` primitive
- Primal: Adds a `Polyhedron` primitive for representing convex polyhedra bounded by planar polygons in 3D
- Primal: Adds a `clip()` operator for computing the intersection of a `Tetrahedron` and an `Octahedron` as a `Polyhedron`
- Klee: Adds a new component, `klee`, for specifying non-conformal shape overlays for materials onto simulation meshes.
  This component defines a schema for defining, transforming and overlaying 2D and 3D shapes
  and validates klee input files. See the [klee documentation](https://axom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/axom/klee/docs/sphinx) for more information.
- Quest: Adds a new query for sampling-based "shaping" onto low- or high-order computational meshes
- Quest: Adds a new query for intersection-based "shaping" of revolved contours onto 3D hexahedral meshes.
  This capability uses a RAJA policy operate on various execution spaces (host, openmp, device).
- Quest: Adds a "shaping" example for embedding a klee specification onto an MFEM mesh
- Added Sidre function `View::clear()`.
- Core now provides an `axom::ArrayView` that provides view/indexing semantics over a raw pointer.
  This replaces the external buffer logic previously provided by `axom::Array`.

### Changed
- `MFEMSidreDataCollection` now reuses FESpace/QSpace objects with the same basis
- Harden configuration options for BLT tools (style, code quality, etc.) against accidentally being enabled for users.  Developers will
  always give a full path (e.g. `CLANGFORMAT_EXECUTABLE`)
- Inlet: `Writer`s are passed directly to `Inlet::write` instead of being registered
- `Inlet` objects can now be constructed without a user-provided `sidre::DataStore`
- Conduit version changed to v. 0.7.2
- Renames `AXOM_DEBUG_VAR` macro to `AXOM_UNUSED_VAR` since there were many cases where the latter
  was not the appropriate name. This macro elides warnings about unused variables
- Inlet's `isUserProvided` can now be used to query the status of subobjects of a `Container` via a name parameter
- Upgrades our `vcpkg` usage for automated Windows builds of our TPLs to its [2021.05.12 release](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/releases/tag/2021.05.12)
- Upgrades built-in `cli11` library to its [v1.9.1 release](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11/releases/tag/v1.9.1)
- Quest's `inout` C API has two new functions: `inout_set_dimension()` and `inout_set_segments_per_knot_span()`.
  The latter is only applicable for 2D queries on `c2c` contours
- Spin: Refactored `BVH` public API based on user suggestions
  `BVH` constructor only handles setting up default values, while the actual building of the BVH is
  now done in a `BVH::initialize(primal::BoundingBox*, int)` method.
  Alternate Umpire allocator IDs are supplied via `BVH::setAllocatorID(int)`.
  Other `BVH` methods have been modified to accept or return Primal primitives.
- Spin: Removed hard dependency on RAJA and Umpire from `BVH`.
- Moved `slam::IteratorBase` to `axom::IteratorBase`.
- `sidre::Array` now derives from `axom::MCArray`.
- `axom::Array` is now multidimensional; it intends to behave like `std::vector` in the 1D case
  and `numpy.ndarray` in the multidimensional case
- Quest: `SignedDistance` has been modified to use `spin::BVH` instead of `BVHTree`. This
  enables signed-distance queries to run on the GPU, as specified via a new template
  parameter.
- Spin: Removed `BVHTree` class in favor of `BVH`.
- Quest's `signed_distance` C API: Removed functions related to old `BVHTree` class
  and added functions related to `BVH` class
    * Removed: `void signed_distance_set_max_levels( int maxLevels )`
    * Removed: `void signed_distance_set_max_occupancy( int maxOccupancy )`
    * Added: `void signed_distance_set_allocator( int allocatorID )`
    * Added: `void signed_distance_set_execution_space( SignedDistExec execSpace )`
- All built-in third-party libraries (`fmt`, `cli11`, `sol`, and `sparsehash`) have been guarded to allow downstream users to
  have their own versions. This includes moving their headers under `include/axom` instead of `include/` and
  moving their C++ namespace under `axom` (eg. `fmt` to `axom::fmt`).  If you don't use our built-n TPLs this has no
  affect on you, but if you do these are some the changes you will need to make:

    | Library    | Namespace changes                 | Header include changes                                          |
    | -----------| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | fmt        | `fmt::` &rarr; `axom::fmt::`      | `#include "fmt/fmt.hpp"` &rarr; `#include "axom/fmt.hpp"`       |
    | sol        | `sol::` &rarr; `axom::sol::`      | `#include "sol/sol.hpp"` &rarr; `#include "axom/sol.hpp"`       |
    | sparsehash | `google::` &rarr; `axom::google::`| `#include "sparsehash` &rarr; `#include "axom/sparsehash`       |
    | cli11      | `CLI::` &rarr; `axom::CLI::`      | `#include "CLI11/CLI11.hpp"` &rarr; `#include "axom/CLI11.hpp"` |

- Moved `axom::MCArray` and the `sidre::Array` it was based on into `mint`
  as `axom::deprecated::MCArray` and `sidre::deprecated::MCArray`, respectively.
  `sidre::Array` is now based on `axom::Array`.
- `utilities::string::split` now returns a vector instead of using an out-parameter,
  Inlet's string utilities were moved to Core, and `splitLastNTokens` was renamed to `rsplitN`
- `axom::Array`-related classes have been moved into individual files.
- RAJA dependency updated to 0.14.0
- Umpire dependency updated to 0.6.0. Support for versions prior to v2.1.0 was removed.
- Conduit dependency updated to 0.7.2+ (develop as of Sept 13, 2021). This was required because Spack
  is now using `HDF5`'s CMake build system.
- Internal BLT dependency updated to 0.4.1


### Fixed
- Fixed Primal's `intersect(Ray, Segment)` calculation for Segments that do not have unit length
- Fixed problem with Cray Fortran compiler not recognizing MSVC pragmas in `axom/config.hpp`.
  The latter are now only added in MSVC configurations.
- Fixed bug in `Mint`'s VTK output for fields of type `int64` and `float`
- Improved loading of data collections in `MFEMSidreDataCollection`
- Added workaround to `MFEMSidreDataCollection` for `C++14` standard library feature that was not available in `gcc@4.9.3`
- Delayed finalizing reloaded mesh in `MFEMSidreDataCollection` until after setting
  the nodal `GridFunction` (when applicable)
- Transposed `R` and `Z` coordinates when linearizing NURBS curves in `c2c` reader
- Fixed user-reported in/out ambiguity within some `InOutOctree` cases with grazing triangles

## [Version 0.5.0] - Release date 2021-05-14

### Added
- Added the MFEMSidreDataCollection class for describing [MFEM] meshes and associated fields.  This
  class was adapted from MFEM's SidreDataCollection and is enabled when Axom is built with MFEM
  *and* the `AXOM_ENABLE_MFEM_SIDRE_DATACOLLECTION` CMake option is enabled.
- Added `slic::setAbortFunction` to configure a custom callback when Slic aborts.
- Added a `batched` option to quest's `InOutOctree` containment query example application.
  This uses a kernel to test for containment on an array of points.
  The query uses OpenMP threading, when available.
- Inlet: Added support for user-defined conversions from Inlet tables to user-defined
  types, and support for arrays of user-defined types
- Added compiler define `NOMINMAX` to `axom/config.hpp.in` to avoid problems with
  the Windows `min` and `max` macros.
- Added `cpp14` variant to Spack package to allow `Inlet::LuaReader` to be used more easily.
- Inlet: Added support for string-keyed associative arrays (dictionaries)
- Inlet: Added support for defining and retrieving functions from the input file

  for autocompletion
- Inlet: SphinxWriter will now document the signature of function callbacks added to a schema
- Axom::Path - New class for performing basic path operations with user-selectable
  delimiter characters
- Inlet: Added a method to `inlet::Inlet` that retrieves the set of unexpected names
  in the input file
- Inlet: Added an option to mark `Container`s as strict, which fail verification when unexpected
  entries are present
- Added support in `MFEMSidreDataCollection` for registering `QFunctions`
  (data associated with quadrature points on a mesh)
- Inlet: The internal hierarchy of an `Inlet` object can be reconstructed from a Sidre group,
  excluding callback functions
- Added new overloaded version of method
  `sidre::DataStore::generateBlueprintIndex` to incorporate new MPI
  features in conduit and allow for generation of a blueprint index on
  an under-decomposed parallel mesh
- Added new method `sidre::View::importArrayNode` to import a
  `conduit::Node` holding array data directly into a `sidre::View`
- Added support for registering material and species sets in
  `MFEMSidreDataCollection`.  These correspond to
  [`matset`](https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh.html#material-sets)s
  and
  [`specset`](https://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint_mesh.html#species-sets)s
  in the Mesh Blueprint

### Changed
- Converted [Uberenv] to a git submodule. We previously vendored a copy of this script.
- The Sidre Datastore no longer rewires Conduit's error handlers to Slic by default.
  It can be  explicitly rewired using the static
  `DataStore::setConduitSLICMessageHandlers()` method.
- Inlet: Changed `SchemaCreator` to an abstract class and added missing functions
- Inlet: Added ability to access the `Reader` class from `Inlet` and Sol Lua state
  from the `LuaReader` class
- Inlet: Switched accessor interface to match that of the STL with `operator[]` and
  `T get<T>()`
- Inlet: `std::shared_ptr<T>` has been replaced with `T&` in non-owning contexts
  and `std::unique_ptr<T>` in owning contexts - specifically, within Inlet's internal
  tree structure
- Unified core and SPIO unit tests into fewer executables to limit size of build directory
- Renamed `axom::slic::UnitTestLogger` to `axom::slic:SimpleLogger` because it's used in
  more than just unit tests.
- Inlet: Input file functions can now be of arbitrary signature subject to type and arity
  restrictions
- Exported all symbols on Windows by default when compiling a dynamic library
- Updated TPL `conduit` to version 0.6.0 released Nov 2, 2020.
- Updated built-in TPL `sparsehash` to version 2.0.4 released Aug 11, 2020.
- Inlet: Exposed `primal::Vector` in Lua for use in input-file-defined functions
- The `MFEMSidreDataCollection` will now reconstruct fields and the mesh when a
  datastore is `Load`ed in
- Inlet: Cleaned up `Table` interface to eliminate ambiguity and duplicated functionality
- Inlet: Renamed `DocWriter` to `Writer` and refactored its interface
- Inlet: Renamed `Table` to `Container`
- Inlet collections of mixed or incorrect type will now fail verification, even if they're
  not marked as required
- Required Inlet collections no longer fail Inlet verification if they are empty in the input file
- Inlet: `operator bool` for `Field` and `Container` has been replaced with more precise `isUserProvided`
  and `exists`, which also returns `true` if a default value was specified.
- Updated built-in TPL `fmt` to master branch snapshot, March 26, 2021.
- Inlet: `SphinxWriter` will now print only one element schema per container instead of
  printing the same schema for each element in the container
- Updated BLT to version 0.4.0 released 9 Apr 2021
- Updated MFEM to version 4.2 released 30 Oct 2020. Axom no longer requires MFEM to be built serially
- The macro for exporting symbols is now `AXOM_EXPORT` instead of `AXOM_API`
- Updated Conduit to v0.6.0
- Updated SCR to compatibility with v3.0rc1

### Fixed
- Updated to new BLT version that does not fail when ClangFormat returns an empty
  version string.  BLT/Axom now issues a warning and disables the `style` build
  target if version is unknown or wrong.
- Inlet: Apply lambda verifiers on generic containers to individual elements
  for consistency
- Inlet: Fixed a bug relating to nested table lookups of primitive arrays and functions
- Fixed a bug relating to deeply nested callback functions in Inlet
- Inlet: Always ignore primitive array elements that do not match the requested type
- Inlet: Empty structs/collections of structs with required sub-elements no longer fail
  verification
- Quest: Fixed a bug with InOutOctree for triangles that lie on faces of octree blocks
- Updated to use newer Conduit config directory
- Add support for legacy hdf5 cmake build system

## [Version 0.4.0] - Release date 2020-09-22

### Added
- Exposed the tolerance parameter `EPS` that is used to determine intersections between
  triangles in `primal:intersect()` as an optional final parameter.
- Added BVH spatial index option to the `mesh_tester` utility for calculating
  triangle-triangle intersection.
- Added `axom::execution_space< ExecSpace >::onDevice()` to check if execution
  space is on device.
- Added Axom macro `AXOM_SUPPRESS_HD_WARN` to silence host device compiler
  warnings.
- Added option to quest's `SignedDistance` class and C API to toggle whether
  the distance query computes the sign.
- Added a `batched` option to quest's signed distance query example application.
  This computes all distance queries on an array of points using a single call to `computeDistance`.
  The query uses OpenMP threading, when available.
- Added new component, Inlet, to assist in retrieving and storing data from
  an input deck.
- Added the ability to specify an [Umpire] allocator ID to use with the
  BVH. This allows the application to use a device allocator for the BVH and
  avoid use of Unified Memory (UM) on the GPU, which can hinder perfomrmance,
  or use a pool allocator to mitigate the latencies associated with allocation/deallocation.
  The allocator ID is specified as an optional argument to the BVH constructor.
- Added new CMake option, `AXOM_ENABLE_ANNOTATIONS`, to enable/disable code
  annotations in Axom. Default is OFF.
- Added Axom annotation macros. The macros can be used to annotate functions,
  using the `AXOM_PERF_MARK_FUNCTION` macro, or at a more fine grain level,
  different sections of code can be annotated by wrapping them within an
  `AXOM_PERF_MARK_SECTION` block. As a first cut, this works with NVTX tools.
  However, the hooks are in place to add support for Caliper in the future.
- Added a simple interface to NVTX that allows an application to set the color
  and category for NVTX ranges corresponding to annotated code in Axom. The
  application can now call `axom::nvtx:set_color()` and
  `axom::nvtx::set_category()` to set the corresponding parameters respectively.
  This facilitates in the performance evaluation by allowing developers to easily
  filter out calls by category or visually by setting a different color to use
  in GUI tools, such as, NVVP and NSight.
- Added a portable floating_point_limits traits class, to return min(), max(), lowest()
  and epsilon() of a `float` or `double` type. The functionality is equivalent to that provided by
  std::numeric_limits, but, the code is host/device decorated accordingly such that it
  can also be called on the device.
- Added initial support for ray queries using the BVH. The caller may now supply a set of rays to
  a BVH and the BVH will return a set of candidate BVH bins that intersect each ray.
- Added initial support for bounding box queries using the BVH. The caller may
  now supply a set of bounding boxes to a BVH and the BVH will return a set of
  candidate BVH bins that intersect each bounding box.
- Added an `axom-config.cmake` file to axom's installation to streamline incorporating axom
  into user applications. See `<axom-install>/examples/axom` for example usages.
- Added [Sol] as a built-in TPL for fast and simple `C++` and `Lua` binding.
  Sol is automatically enabled when `LUA_DIR` is found.
  The version of Sol used in this release is `v2.20.6`, which requires `C++14`.

### Removed
- Removed the `AXOM_ENABLE_CUB` option, since `CUB` is no lonher used directly in
  Axom code. Instead, we use `RAJA::stable_sort` with RAJA-v0.12.1 and fallback
  to `std::stable_sort` with older versions of RAJA and when the code is built
  without RAJA.

### Changed
- Updated Axom to support RAJA-v0.12.1 and Umpire-v4.01, but the code remains
  backwards compatible with previous versions of RAJA and Umpire.
- Transitioned Axom's code formatting tool from `Uncrustify` to [clang-format].
  Axom's clang-format rules depend on clang 10.
- Modified the command line interface for `mesh_tester` utility. Interface
  now uses a *-m, --method* option to select the spatial index, and *-p, policy*
  option now accepts a string or integer value.
- Renamed the `AXOM_USE_MPI3`option to `AXOM_ENABLE_MPI3` for consistency.
- Modified the API for the BVH to accomodate different query types. The queries are now
  more explicitly called `BVH::findPoints()` and `BVH::findRays()`.
- Modified the API of Axom's memory management routines to not leak usage of Umpire. Instead of
  passing an `umpire::Allocator` object to specify an allocator, we now use the corresponding
  integer ID associated with the allocator.
- All names in the C API now preserve the case of the C++ function.
  ex. `SIDRE_datastore_new` is now `SIDRE_DataStore_new`.
- Fortran API in slic module. `axom::slic::message` Level enums are changed
  from  *enum-name_enumerator* to *namespace_enumerator*.
  ex. `level_error` is now `message_error`.
- Fortran derived-type constructors are now generic functions named afer the derived type.
  `datastore_new` is now `SidreDataStore`
  `iomanager_new` is now `IOManager`

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `primal::intersect(Segment, BoundingBox)` and added regression tests.
- Spin's octrees can now be used with 64-bit indexes. This allows octrees
  with up to 64 levels of resolution when using a 64-bit index type.
- Resolved issue with `AXOM_USE_64BIT_INDEXTYPE` configurations. Axom can once again
  be configured with 64-bit index types.
- Fixed a triangle-triangle intersection case in primal that produced inconsistent results
  depending on the order of the triangle's vertices.
- Fixed issue in the parallel construction of the BVH on GPUs, due to incoherent
  L1 cache that could result in some data corruption in the BVH. The code now
  calls ``__threadfence_system()`` after the parent is computed and stored back
  to global memory to ensure that the *write*  is visible to all threads.
- Fixed issue in Mint that would cause the clang@9.0.0 compiler to segfault. The
  `mint_cell_types.cpp` test was causing a segfault in the compiler. The main
  issue triggering this compiler bug was the use of `constexpr` when defining the
  static `cell_info` array of structs. The code has been modified to use `const`
  instead.
- Fixed issue in Quest's Signed Distance query that would prevent consecutive
  calls to Quest when MPI-3 shared memory is enabled due to not properly
  nullifying internal pointers when finalize is called.
- Fixed issue where the BVH would dispatch to the CPU sort() routine when the
  specified execution policy was CUDA_EXEC async. Now, when the execution policy
  is CUDA_EXEC the code would correctly dispatch to the GPU sort, using CUB
  (when CUB is enabled), regardless of whether it's synchronous or asynchronous.
- Fixed issue with missing the bvh_traverse.hpp from the install prefix, which was preventing
  applications from using the BVH when pointing to an Axom install prefix.
- Fixed usage of cuda kernel policies in Mint. Raja v0.11.0 changed the way max threads
  launch bounds is calculated. Consequently, a large number of threads was being launched
  leading to max registry count violation when linking. We are now using fixed kernel size
  of 256 threads (16x16 in 2D and 8x8x4 in 3D).
- Third-party libraries can now build on the Windows platform through uberenv using vcpkg
  ("zero-to-axom support on Windows")

### Known Bugs
- Encountered a compiler bug on IBM LC platforms when using the IBM XL C/C++
  compiler. The issue is manifested in the `generate_aabbs_and_centroids` method
  in the `spin_bvh.cpp` unit test. It seems that the compiler does not handle
  the lambda capture of the arrays correctly which leads to a segfault. A
  workaround for the IBM XL compiler is provided.
- There is a known bug in MVAPICH that prevents consecutive creation/deletion
  of MPI windows. This was encountered on LC platforms when enabling shared
  memory in the Signed Distance Query. See the corresponding
  [Github Issue](https://github.com/LLNL/axom/issues/257) for details.

## [Version 0.3.3] - Release date 2020-01-31

### Added
- Define different execution spaces. This refines and consolidates
  the execution policy concepts from mint and spin, which are now defined in
  Axom core, such that they can be used by other components.
- Added a generic axom::for_all(), which can be used to write simple parallel
  loops.
- Added [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) command line parser as a built-in third party library.

### Changed
- Updated Conduit to v0.5.1
- Updated RAJA to v0.11.0
- Updated Umpire to v2.1.0, which, natively handles zero byte re-allocations consistently. Workaround
  for older releases of Umpire is in place for backwards compatibility.
- Updated BLT to develop (f0ab9a4) as of Jan 15, 2020
- Set CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION globally instead of just in a few components.
- Reduced verbosity of quest's InOutOctree in cases where query point lies on surface.
- Changed semantics of ``axom::reallocate(_, 0)`` to always return a valid pointer.
  This matches the semantics of Umpire's ``reallocate(_, 0)``.
  Note: Umpire's PR-292 fixed a bug in its handling of this case and Axom
  includes a workaround to get the new behavior until we upgrade to Umpire v2.0+.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in ``convert_sidre_protocol`` example. Data truncation functionality now
  works properly when multiple Views point to the same data.


## [Version 0.3.2] - Release date 2019-09-22

### Added
- Added support in Mint for reading and writing an unstructured mesh in the [SU2 Mesh file format].
  This includes support for both single and mixed cell type topology unstructured mesh types.
- Added a new option to enable/disable use of CUB, `AXOM_USE_CUB`, which is disabled by default. This
  allows to disable CUB to circumvent issues encountered with the device linker.
- Added a BezierCurve primitive type to primal. A new ``intersect`` operator was also added to
  compute the intersection points between a pair of Bezier curves of arbitrary order.

### Changed
- Updated Raja TPL to v0.9.0
- Updated Umpire TPL to v1.0.0
- `AXOM_USE_OPENMP` is now being set at configure time accordingly instead of
  auto-detected based on whether `_OPENMP` is passed by the compiler. This
  fixes issues where a host code would compile Axom w/out OpenMP, but, use
  Axom in parts of the code where OpenMP is enabled.

### Fixed
- Fixed usage of Umpire's MemoryResourceType enum in Axom. Axom was assuming that
  there was a one-to-one correspondance of the entries in the MemoryResourceType enum
  and the IDs of the predefined allocators. However, this assumption generally does
  not hold. This version corrects this by explicitly querying the ID of the predefined
  allocator for a particular resource and using that subsequently in the code.


## [Version 0.3.1] - Release date 2019-07-22

### Added
- Added a new implementation of the Bounding Volume Hierarchy(BVH) spatial
  acceleration data-structure to spin. The new BVH implementation relies on RAJA
  and allows for constructing and using the BVH sequentially or in parallel on
  the CPU or in parallel on the GPU. The new implementation is available only
  when Axom is compiled with RAJA and Umpire support.
- Added Umpire and RAJA to the spack build.
- Centralized Axom's memory management functions in a separate header and extended them
  to use Umpire when enabled.
- Added the ability to point Axom to an UMPIRE build by specifying UMPIRE_DIR either in
  a host-config or at the command line. Axom components can link to Umpire, by specifying
  "umpire" as a dependency. A simple umpire smoke test is also added for regression testing.
- Added for_all_faces to the mint execution model.
- Added support for face connectivity in the mint UnstructuredMesh class.
- Added support for face data and face connectivity in the mint StructuredMesh classes.
- Added Python module for Quest signed distance interface.
  See the file src/axom/quest/interface/python/README.md for more information.
- Added capability in sidre IOManager to read files while running on a number
  of MPI ranks greater than the number of ranks that were used to create
  the files.
- Users can now set the vertex welding threshold parameter in Quest's In/Out query.
  This was previously not exposed to the user. The default value is 1E-9.
- Unify all Axom component libraries into one library named axom.
- The routine that checks if a surface mesh is watertight now marks boundary
  cells. A cell-centered field, named "boundary", is used to mark  boundary cells
  with a value  of  "1" and "0" otherwise. This facilitates in visually inspecting the
  surface mesh and identify the problematic regions for the In/Out and SignedDistance
  queries.

### Removed
- Moved `mint::Array` to `axom::Array` with sidre storage in `sidre::Array`;
  also moved `mint::IndexType` to `axom::IndexType`.
- Replaced `sidre::SidreLength` with `sidre::IndexType`.
- Replaced usage of std::size_t in sidre with `sidre::IndexType`.
- Added `AXOM_ENABLE_EXPORTS` which enables `CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS` to allow demangled
  axom function names in stack traces. This option is ON by default in debug builds.


### Changed
- Updated conduit TPL to v0.4.0
- Updated mfem TPL to v4.0
- Slam's Set and Relation classes are now parameterized by a PositionType and ElementType.
  Its Map classes are now parametrized by a SetType.
- Updated the fmt tpl.
- Replaced old quest C-style interface with a new quest inout API.
  Functions related to the inout point containment query are prefixed with `inout_`.
  The new API has an option to set the verbosity of the inout initialization and query.
- Changed `sidre::IndexType` to be a 64bit signed integer.
- Changed `slic::stack_trace` to `slic::internal::stack_trace` which now attempts to
  output a demangled stack trace.

### Fixed
- Axom can once again be configured with `AXOM_ENABLE_EXAMPLES=ON` and `AXOM_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF`.
- Quest's vertex welding now works with small welding threshold values (e.g. 1E-20).
  Welding was previously broken when this value was smaller than 1E-8.
  This fix also resolved an issue with small grid spacing values in primal's RectangularLattice.


## [Version 0.3.0] - Release date 2018-08-02

### Added
- Added initial implementation of a RAJA-based mesh-aware execution model in Mint.
  The execution model provides a functional interface for generic traversals and
  various mesh traversals, e.g., looping over all the nodes or cells of the mesh.
- Added AXOM macros for lambda expressions and host/device decorators
- Added the ability to point Axom to a RAJA build by specifying `RAJA_DIR` at
  a host config or at the config-build.py. Axom components can now link RAJA
  by specifying "raja" as a dependency. A simple RAJA smoke test is also added
  for regression testing.
- Added `isStructured()` and `isUnstructured()` convenience methods to the mint::Mesh object.
- Added support for using MPI-3 on-node shared memory data-structures to store
  the input surface mesh in quest. Instead of each rank duplicating the mesh
  data (e.g. node coordinates and cell connectivity), ranks within the same
  compute node can now share and utilize the same mesh data buffer. This reduces
  the memory overhead associated with duplicating the mesh at each rank which can
  be a limiting factor when reading large meshes. This feature is currently only
  exposed in Quest's signed distance query and requires Axom to be compiled with
  MPI-3 support (i.e., setting `AXOM_USE_MPI3=ON`)
- Added the ability to call resize() on a Mint UnstructuredMesh. This functionality
  was not previously exposed in the UnstructuredMesh API.
- Added support for non-closed surface mesh input to the signed distance query.
- Added new interface for the signed distance query along with corresponding tests
  and examples.
- Updated to [fmt version 5.1.0](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/releases/tag/5.1.0)
- Added `AXOM_ENABLE_TESTS` which is a CMake dependent option of ENABLE_TESTS
- Added `AXOM_ENABLE_DOCS` which is a CMake dependent option of ENABLE_DOCS
- Added `AXOM_ENABLE_EXAMPLES` which is a CMake dependent option of ENABLE_EXAMPLES
- Added jacobi_eigensolve() method for computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  of real, symmetric matrices.
- Added matrix_norm() operator for computing matrix norms. The implementations
  supports the p1-norm, infinity-norm and frobenious matrix norm.
- Added eigen_sort() routine for sorting the supplied eigenvalues and corresponding
  eigenvectors in ascending order.
- Initial integration of Mint and Sidre. Mint can now operate on meshes
  stored in Sidre and conform to the [computational mesh blueprint conventions](http://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/blueprint.html).
- Added a sphere-sphere intersection test to Primal.
- Added a utility function to Quest to *weld* vertices in a triangle mesh that
  are within a given tolerance. After welding, all triangles incident in a
  vertex have the same index for that vertex. This function has been integrated
  into the ``mesh_tester`` utility.
- Added a bounded All-Nearest-Neighbor query to Quest. This query takes a list
  of point locations and associated regions, and for each point reports the
  nearest point in a different region that is no farther than a max search
  radius.
- Axom now exports [sparsehash version 2.0.3](https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash). Previously, it was only used internally.
- Added a BitSet class to Slam.
- Added a Tetrahedron primitive to Primal.
- Added an in_sphere operator to Primal, which is a predicate that
  is used extensively for Delaunay triangulations.

### Removed
- Axom no longer depends on the Boost library.
- Removed `ENABLE_PYTHON` CMake option. Python was only used by Shroud so restricted Python
  checks to when Shroud generation is enabled
- Removed Lua as a dependency of Axom.
- Removed signed distance query functions from the `quest.hpp` interface. The
  signed distance query is supported in its own exclusive interface.
- Removed `AXOM_NULLPTR`. Use `nullptr` instead.

### Changed
- Simplified the external constructors for the Mint UnstructuredMesh. Specifically,
  the caller is no longer required to: (a) specify the dimension, which can be computed
  internaly based on other input arguments, and (b) specify explicitly the capacity for
  the node coordinate and connectivity arrays. In the more common case, the capacity is
  equivalent to the associated size when constructing a mesh by supplied external buffers.
- Restructured source directory.  #includes will now mirror file structure.  For
  example, '#include "sidre/Group.hpp"' is now '#include "axom/sidre/core/Group.hpp"'.
- The root CMake file for Axom is now located in ``<axom>/src``'s root directory,
  rather than in ``<axom>``
- Prefixed all Axom CMake options with AXOM_ to avoid conflicts
- `ENABLE_SPARSEHASH` -> `AXOM_ENABLE_SPARSEHASH`
- `ENABLE_ALL_COMPONENTS` -> `AXOM_ENABLE_COMPONENTS`
- `ENABLE_<component name>` -> `AXOM_ENABLE_<component name>`
- `MINT_USE_64BIT_INDEXTYPE` -> `AXOM_MINT_USE_64BIT_INDEXTYPE`
- `MINT_USE_SIDRE` -> `AXOM_MINT_USE_SIDRE`
- CMake minimum is now 3.8 for non-CUDA builds and 3.9 for CUDA builds
- Axom now requires a C++11 compiler.
- Refactored Axom's Matrix/Vector operators and consolidated them in one file.
- Removed overloaded arithmetic operators from the Matrix class to avoid
  potential negative performance impacts. Applications should use the new
``matvecops`` methods for such operations.
- Quest STL reader now returns a status code, indicating whether reading
  the STL file was successful. Also, the reader now leverages the improved
  Mint API to reserve storage for mesh and avoid re-allocations when reading
  the STL mesh data into the Mint mesh.
- Refactored and cleaned up Primal's Sphere class.
- Refactored Mint and removed all STL usage in preparation for GPUs.

### Fixed
- Fixed minor memory leak in quest fortran example
- Bugfix for "multiply-defined" linker error in `slam::Bitset` and `quest::PointInCellTraits`


## [Version 0.2.9] - Release date 2018-03-08

### Added
- Updated to [conduit version 0.3.1](https://github.com/LLNL/conduit/tree/v0.3.1)
- Updated to [shroud version 0.8.8](https://github.com/LLNL/shroud/tree/v0.8.0)
- Improved platform support for LLNL's ``blue_os`` and ``bg/q`` systems.
  Axom now builds with Fortran enabled using the xlc and clang compilers.
- Improved support for Axom on Windows, including new host-configs for
  Microsoft's Visual Studio compiler and for the intel compiler on Windows.
  All Axom components can now be built on Windows, but we do not yet support
  hdf5 or Fortran on Windows.
- Added geometric Plane primitive to Primal. The Plane defines an oriented
  plane in 2D and 3D and provides support for operations such as projection of
  a point to a plane, signed distance and orientation.
- Added ability to configure Axom (in particular Sidre and Spio) without hdf5.
- Improved testing of [Scalable Checkpoint Restart (SCR)] library in Sidre.
- Added a Point-In-Cell query to Quest. The Point In Cell query finds the cell
  in a computational mesh that contains an arbitrary point in space.
  If such a cell exists, it also finds the isoparametric coordinates of the
  point with respect to the cell. The query supports higher order
  [mfem](http://mfem.org) meshes.
- Added cross-product and linspace operators to the vector utilities in
``numerics``

### Changed
- The root cmake file for Axom is now located in ``<axom>``'s root directory,
  rather than in ``<axom>/src``
- ``primal`` is no longer a header-only library.
- Modified ``quest`` API to allow using a ``mint`` mesh that is already
  resident in memory.

### Fixed
- Fixed a divide-by-zero problem in ``primal::intersect()``
- Fixed the calculation of the Jacobian in ``mint::FiniteElement`` to support
  elements that are in higher-dimensional ambient space, e.g., surface elements,
  a Triangle or Quad in 3D.
