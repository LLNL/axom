*******************************
GPU Porting in Axom
*******************************

Axom uses the following two libraries as the main workhorses for GPU porting:

  * `RAJA <https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA>`_:
    Handles software abstractions that enable architecture and programming
    model portability for HPC applications
  * `Umpire <https://github.com/LLNL/Umpire>`_:
    Resource management library that allows the discovery, provision, and
    management of memory on machines with multiple memory devices like NUMA
    and GPUs.

From RAJA and Umpire, Axom derives a set of convenience macros and function
wrappers in the ``axom`` namespace encapsulating commonly-used RAJA and Umpire
functions, and preset execution spaces for host/device execution.

For the user's guide on using GPU utilities, see also
:ref:`Core Acceleration<core-acceleration>`.


.. _gpu-macros-label:

===============
Macros 
===============

Axom's macros can be found in the file
`axom/core/Macros.hpp <https://github.com/LLNL/axom/blob/develop/src/axom/core/Macros.hpp>`_.

Most of the GPU-related macros are used to guard device code for compilation.

For guarding device code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/Macros.hpp
   :start-after:  _guarding_macros_start
   :end-before:  _guarding_macros_end
   :language: C++

.. note::

  * Functions called in CUDA or HIP GPU device code require the ``__device__``
    annotation.
  * Functions that will be called in device code *and* CPU host code require
    the ``__host__ __device__`` annotation.

The following code shows the macros used in Axom to apply these annotations:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/Macros.hpp
   :start-after:  _decorating_macros_start
   :end-before:  _decorating_macros_end
   :language: C++

Below is a function that uses Axom macros to apply a ``__host__ __device__``
annotation and guard the use of a CUDA intrinsic to inside a kernel:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/utilities/BitUtilities.hpp
   :start-after:  gpu_macros_example_start
   :end-before:  gpu_macros_example_end
   :language: C++

.. _gpu-memory-label:

===============
Memory 
===============

Axom's memory management routines can be found in the file
`axom/core/memory_management.hpp <https://github.com/LLNL/axom/blob/develop/src/axom/core/memory_management.hpp>`_.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Memory Management Routines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Umpire has the concept of "allocators" associated with each
`memory resource type`_ (``umpire::resource::MemoryResourceType``).

To allocate memory on a particular resource, you use the ID for the allocator
associated with the ``umpire::resource::MemoryResourceType``.

You are able to set a default allocator, whereby all your memory allocations
will go on the resource associated with the allocator unless otherwise
specified:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/memory_management.hpp
   :start-after:  _memory_management_routines_start
   :end-before:  _memory_management_routines_end
   :language: C++

.. note::

  When Axom is built without Umpire, the getters and setters shown above
  become no-ops or are undefined, while the memory allocation functions
  default to C++ standard library functions with only allocation on the
  host (CPU):

  * ``axom::allocate`` calls ``std::malloc``
  * ``axom::deallocate`` calls ``std::free``
  * ``axom::reallocate`` calls ``std::realloc``
  * ``axom::copy`` calls ``std::memcpy``


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MemorySpace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/memory_management.hpp
   :start-after:  _memory_space_start
   :end-before:  _memory_space_end
   :language: C++

Axom provides the ``axom::MemorySpace`` enum type to define values indicating
the memory space where data in
``axom::Array`` and ``axom::ArrayView`` lives.

``Dynamic`` allows you to define the location at run time, with some caveats
(see :ref:`Core Containers<core-containers>` for more details and examples).

.. _gpu-kernels-label:

===============
Kernels
===============

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
axom::for_all
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``axom::for_all`` can be found in the file
`axom/core/execution/for_all.hpp <https://github.com/LLNL/axom/blob/develop/src/axom/core/execution/for_all.hpp>`_.

``axom::for_all`` is a wrapper around `RAJA forall`_, which is used to execute
simple for-loop kernels.

This is used in Axom to execute for-loop style kernels that will be run on a
GPU device, or on both a GPU device and a CPU host. For example::

  template <typename ExecSpace, typename KernelType>
  void axom::for_all(const IndexType& N, KernelType&& kernel)

  template <typename ExecSpace, typename KernelType>
  void axom::for_all(const IndexType& begin, const IndexType& end, KernelType&& kernel)

.. note::

  When Axom is built without RAJA, ``axom::for_all`` becomes a ``for``-loop on
  host (CPU).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RAJA::kernel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``RAJA::kernel`` is used to execute kernels implemented using nested loops.

This is used infrequently, mainly seen only in a `few unit tests`_.

Your general go-to will be ``axom::for_all``.

kernel execution methods.


.. _gpu-execution-spaces-label:

================================
Execution Spaces & Policies
================================

Axom's execution spaces can be found in the file
`axom/core/execution/execution_space.hpp <https://github.com/LLNL/axom/blob/develop/src/axom/core/execution/execution_space.hpp>`_.

Axom's execution spaces are derived from an ``axom::execution_space<ExecSpace>``
traits class containing RAJA execution policies and default Umpire memory
allocators associated with each space.

Axom currently supports `four execution spaces`_, each one a type with the
following specialization of the ``execution_space`` class:

* ``SEQ_EXEC`` - Sequential execution policies on host
* ``OMP_EXEC`` -  OpenMP execution policies on host
* ``CUDA_EXEC`` - CUDA execution policies in Unified Memory (host + device)
* ``HIP_EXEC`` - HIP execution policies in Unified Memory (host + device)

Additionally, ``HIP_EXEC`` and ``CUDA_EXEC`` types are templated by the
number of threads and SYNCHRONOUS or ASYNC execution:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/execution/internal/cuda_exec.hpp
   :start-after:  _cuda_exec_start
   :end-before:  _cuda_exec_end
   :language: C++

Each execution space provides:

* Axom policies that are type aliases of RAJA policies to be used with kernels,
  RAJA types, and RAJA operations

  * ``loop_policy`` - For `RAJA scans`_ and other operations; ``axom::for_all``
    uses the loop_policy from the templated execution space.
  * ``reduce_policy`` - For  `RAJA reduction types`_ that perform reduction
    operations:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/examples/core_acceleration.cpp
     :start-after:  _gpu_reduce_start
     :end-before:  _gpu_reduce_end
     :language: C++

  * ``atomic_policy`` - For `RAJA atomic operations`_ that avoid race
    conditions when updating data values:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/examples/core_acceleration.cpp
     :start-after:  _gpu_atomic_start
     :end-before:  _gpu_atomic_end
     :language: C++

  * ``sync_policy`` - For Axom's `synchronize`_ function, which is a wrapper
    around ``RAJA::synchronize()``. Synchronizes execution threads when using
    an asynchronous ``loop_policy``:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../axom/core/execution/synchronize.hpp
     :start-after:  _gpu_synchronize_start
     :end-before:  _gpu_synchronize_end
     :language: C++

* Umpire allocator defaults

  * ``memory_space`` - The memory space abstraction for use by
    :ref:`Core Containers<core-containers>` like ``axom::Array``.
  * ``allocatorID()`` - Gets the allocator ID for the Umpire resource to use in
    this execution space.

* General information on the execution space

  * ``name()`` - Name of the execution space
  * ``onDevice()`` - Is the execution space on device? (True/False)
  * ``valid()`` - Is the execution space valid? (True)
  * ``async()`` - Is the execution space asynchronous? (True/False)

The :doc:`Core <../../../axom/core/docs/sphinx/index>` component provides a set of nested execution policies
located at
`axom/axom/execution/nested_for_exec.hpp <https://github.com/LLNL/axom/blob/develop/src/axom/core/execution/nested_for_exec.hpp>`_
to be used with
``RAJA::kernel`` e.g. for iterating over mint meshes.  (These generic policies formerly resided in
:doc:`Mint <../../../axom/mint/docs/sphinx/index>` and have been moved to
:doc:`Core <../../../axom/core/docs/sphinx/index>`.)

.. note::

  When Axom is built without RAJA, only ``SEQ_EXEC`` is available
  for host (CPU) execution. When Axom is built with RAJA but without
  Umpire for memory management on device, only
  ``SEQ_EXEC`` and ``OMP_EXEC`` is available for host (CPU) execution.


.. _gpu-tips-label:

================================
General, Rough Porting Tips
================================

* Start with figuring out what memory you need on device, and use
  ``axom::Array``, ``axom::ArrayView``, and
  :ref:`memory_managment routines<gpu-memory-label>`
  to do the allocations:

  .. code-block:: c

    // Allocate 100 2D Triangles in unified memory
    using cuda_exec = axom::CUDA_EXEC<256>;
    using TriangleType = axom::primal::Triangle<double, 2>;
    axom::Array<Triangle> tris (100, axom::execution_space<cuda_exec>::allocatorID()));
    axom::ArrayView<Triangle> tris_view(tris);

    // Allocate the sum of Triangle areas
    using reduce_pol = typename axom::execution_space<cuda_exec>::reduce_policy;
    RAJA::ReduceSum<reduce_pol, double> totalArea(0);

* Using an ``axom::for_all`` kernel with a device policy, attempt to
  access and/or manipulate the memory on device:

  .. code-block:: c

      axom::for_all<cuda_exec>(
      100,
      AXOM_LAMBDA(int idx) {
        // Set values on device
        tris_view[idx] = Triangle();
        totalArea = 0;
      });

* Add the functions you want to call on device to the ``axom::for_all`` kernel:

  .. code-block:: c

      axom::for_all<cuda_exec>(
      100,
      AXOM_LAMBDA(int idx) {
        tris_view[idx] = Triangle();
        totalArea = 0;

        // Call area() method on device
        double area = tris_view[idx].area();
      });

* Apply a ``__host__ __device__`` annotation to your functions if you see the
  following error or similar::

    error: reference to __host__ function 'area' in __host__ __device__ function

  * Recompiling will likely introduce complaints about more
    functions (the functions being the non-decorated functions your
    newly-decorated functions are calling)::

      error: reference to __host__ function 'abs<double>' in __host__ __device__ function

      error: reference to __host__ function 'signedArea<2>' in __host__ __device__ function

    Keep decorating until all the complaints are gone.

  * Most of the C++ standard library is not available on device. Your options
    are Axom's equivalent functions/classes if it exists, or to add your
    own or rewrite the code to not use standard library.

* With no more decorating complaints from the compiler, write the logically
  correct kernel:

  .. code-block:: c

      // Computes the total area of a 100 triangles
      axom::for_all<cuda_exec>(
        100,
        AXOM_LAMBDA(int idx) {
          totalArea += tris_view[idx].area();
      });

  * If at this point your kernel is not working/segfaulting, it is hopefully a
    logical error, and you can debug the kernel without diving into debugging
    tools.
  * Utilize ``printf()`` for debugging output
  * Try using the ``SEQ_EXEC`` execution space
