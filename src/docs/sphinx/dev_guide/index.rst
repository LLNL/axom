Axom Developer Guide
#####################

This guide describes important aspects of software development processes used
by the Axom project. It does not contain information about building the code or
coding guidelines. Please see the note below.

This development guide is intended for all team members and contributors. 
It is especially helpful for individuals who are less familiar with the project
and wish to understand how the team works. We attempt to employ simple 
practices that are easy to understand and follow and which improve our software
without being overly burdensome. We believe that when everyone on our team 
follows similar practices, the likelihood that our software will be 
high quality (i.e., robust, correct, easy to use, etc.) is improved. Everyone 
who contributes to Axom should be aware of and follow these guidelines.

We also believe that the benefits of uniformity and rigor are best balanced 
with allowances for individual preferences, which may work better in 
certain situations. Therefore, we do not view these processes as fixed 
for all time. They should evolve with project needs and be improved when 
it makes sense. Changes should be agreed to by team members after 
assessing their merits using our collective professional judgment. When 
changes are made, this guide should be updated accordingly.

.. note:: This document does not describe how to configure and build the
          Axom code, or discuss Axom coding guidelines. For information
          on those topics please refer to the following documents:
