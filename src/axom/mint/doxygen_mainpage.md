Mint {#minttop}
============

[Mint](@ref axom::mint) is a C++ library that provides:

1. A comprehensive  [mesh](@ref axom::mint::Mesh) data model that can support
   structured, unstructured and particle mesh discretizations.

2. A mesh-aware execution model that supports on-node fine-grain parallelism for 
   traversing and operating on a mesh. 
   
Mint serves as as fundmental building block that underpins the development of
computational tools and numerical discretization methods, enabling implementations 
that are born *parallel* and *portable* to new and emerging architectures.
