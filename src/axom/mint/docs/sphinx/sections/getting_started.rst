Getting Started with Mint
---------------------------

This section presents a complete code walk-through of an example Mint
application, designed to illustrate some of the key concepts and capabilities
of Mint. The complete :ref:`MintApplicationCodeExample`, is included in the
:ref:`sections/mint/appendix` section and is also available in the Axom source
code under ``src/axom/mint/examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp``.

The example Mint application demonstrates how Mint is used to develop
kernels that are both *mesh-agnostic* and *device-agnostic*.

.. tip::

    Mint's `RAJA`_-based :ref:`sections/execution_model` helps facilitate
    the implementation of various computational kernels that are both
    *mesh-agnostic* and *device-agnostic*. Both kernels discussed in
    this example do not make any assumptions about the underlying mesh
    type or the target execution device, e.g. CPU or GPU. Consequently, the
    same implementation can operate on both :ref:`StructuredMesh` and
    :ref:`UnstructuredMesh` types and run sequentially or in parallel on all
    execution devices supported through `RAJA`_.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Understanding the discussion and material presented in this section requires:

* Working knowledge of C++ templates and `Lambda Expression`_ functions.
* High-level understanding of nested memory hierarchies on heterogeneous
  architectures and `CUDA Unified Memory`_.
* Basics of the :ref:`sections/execution_model` (recommended)

.. note::

  Mint does not provide a memory manager. The application must explicitly
  specify the desired allocation strategy and memory space to use. This is
  facilitated by using `Umpire`_ for memory management. Specifically, this
  example uses `CUDA Unified Memory`_ when compiled with `RAJA`_ and CUDA
  enabled by setting the default `Umpire`_ allocator in the beginning of the
  program as follows:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_set_memory_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_set_memory_end
   :language: C++

  When `Umpire`_ , `RAJA`_ and CUDA are not enabled, the code will use the
  ``malloc()`` internally to allocate memory on the host and all kernels will
  be executed on the CPU.

Goals
^^^^^^

Completion of the walk-though of this simple code example should only require a
few minutes. Upon completion, the user will be familiar with using Mint to:

* Create and evaluate fields on a mesh
* Use the :ref:`NodeTraversalFunctions` and :ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` of the
  :ref:`sections/execution_model` to implement kernels that operate on the
  mesh and associated fields.
* Plot the mesh and associated fields in VTK for visualization.

.. _step1:

Step 1: Add Header Includes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, the Mint header must be included for the
definition of the various Mint classes and functions. Note, this example also
makes use of Axom's Matrix class, which is also included by the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_includes_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_includes_end
   :language: C++
   :linenos:

.. _step2:

Step 2: Get a Mesh
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example application is designed to operate on either a :ref:`StructuredMesh`
or an :ref:`UnstructuredMesh`. The type of mesh to use is specified by a runtime
option that can be set by the user at the command line. See :ref:`step7` for
more details.

To make the code work with both :ref:`StructuredMesh` and :ref:`UnstructuredMesh`
instances the kernels are developed in terms of the :ref:`TheMeshBaseClass`,
``mint::Mesh``.

The pointer to a ``mint::Mesh`` object is acquired as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_construct_mesh_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_construct_mesh_end
   :language: C++
   :linenos:

When using a :ref:`UniformMesh`, the mesh is constructed by the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_construct_umesh_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_construct_umesh_end
   :language: C++
   :linenos:

This creates an :math:`N \times N` :ref:`UniformMesh`, defined on a
domain given by the interval :math:`\mathcal{I}:[-5.0,5.0] \times [-5.0,5.0]`,
where :math:`N=25`, unless specified otherwise by the user at the command line.

When an :ref:`UnstructuredMesh` is used, the code will generate the
:ref:`UniformMesh` internally and triangulate it by subdividing each
quadrilateral element into four triangles. See the complete
:ref:`MintApplicationCodeExample` for details.

See the :ref:`sections/tutorial` for more details on how to
:ref:`createAUniformMesh` or :ref:`createAnUnstructuredMesh`.

.. _step3:

Step 3: Add Fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fields are added to the mesh by calling the ``createField()`` method
on the mesh object:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_add_fields_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_add_fields_end
   :language: C++
   :linenos:

* The *node-centered* field, ``phi``, stores the result, computed in :ref:`step4`
* The *cell-centered* field, ``hc``, stores the nodal average of ``phi``, computed in :ref:`step5`
* The *cell-centered* field, ``xc``, stores the cell-centers, computed in :ref:`step5`

Note, the template argument to the ``createField()`` method indicates the
underlying field type, e.g. ``double``, ``int`` , etc. In this case, all three
fields have a ``double`` field type.

The first required argument to the ``createField()`` method is a *string*
corresponding to the *name* of the field. The second argument, which is also
required, indicates the centering of the field, i.e. *node-centered*,
*cell-centered* or *face-centered*.

A third, *optional*, argument *may* be specified to indicate the number of
components of the corresponding field. In this case, the node-centered field,
``phi``, is a scalar field. However, the cell-centered field, ``xc``,
is a 2D vector quantity, which is specified explicitly by
supplying the third argument in the ``createField()`` method invocation.

.. note::
    Absence of the third argument when calling ``createField()`` indicates
    that the number of components of the field defaults to :math:`1` and thereby
    the field is assumed to be a scalar quantity.

See the :ref:`sections/tutorial` for more details on :ref:`workingWithFields`
on a mesh.

.. _step4:

Step 4: Evaluate a Scalar Field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first kernel employs the ``for_all_nodes()`` traversal function of the
:ref:`sections/execution_model` to iterate over the constituent
mesh :ref:`Nodes` and evaluate `Himmelblau's Function`_ at each node:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_compute_hf_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_compute_hf_end
   :language: C++
   :linenos:

* The arguments to the ``for_all_nodes()`` function consists of:

  #. A pointer to the mesh object, and
  #. The *kernel* that defines the *per-node* operations, encapsulated within a
     `Lambda Expression`_, using the convenience :ref:`axomLambdaMacro`.

* In addition, the ``for_all_nodes()`` function has two template arguments:

  #. ``ExecPolicy``:
     The execution policy specifies, *where* and *how* the kernel is executed.
     It is a required template argument that corresponds to an
     :ref:`executionPolicy` defined by the :ref:`sections/execution_model`.

  #. ``xargs::xy``:
     Indicates that in addition to the index of the node, ``nodeIdx``, the
     kernel takes the ``x`` and ``y`` node coordinates as additional arguments.

Within the body of the kernel, `Himmelblau's Function`_ is evaluated using the
supplied ``x`` and ``y`` node coordinates. The result is stored in the
corresponding field array, ``phi``, which is captured by the
`Lambda Expression`_, at the corresponding node location, ``phi[ nodeIdx ]``.

See the :ref:`sections/tutorial` for more details on using the
:ref:`NodeTraversalFunctions` of the :ref:`sections/execution_model`.

.. _step5:

Step 5: Average to Cell Centers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second kernel employs the ``for_all_cells()`` traversal function of the
:ref:`sections/execution_model` to iterate over the constituent mesh
:ref:`Cells` and performs the following:

#. computes the corresponding cell centroid, a 2D *vector* quantity,
#. averages the node-centered field, ``phi``, computed in :ref:`step4`, at the
   cell center.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_cell_centers_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_cell_centers_end
   :language: C++
   :linenos:

* Similarly, the arguments to the ``for_all_cells()`` function consists of:

  #. A pointer to the mesh object, and
  #. The *kernel* that defines the *per-cell* operations, encapsulated within a
     `Lambda Expression`_, using the convenience :ref:`axomLambdaMacro`.

* In addition, the ``for_all_cells()`` function has two template arguments:

  #. ``ExecPolicy``:
     As with the ``for_all_nodes()`` function, the execution policy specifies,
     *where* and *how* the kernel is executed.

  #. ``xargs::coords``:
     Indicates that in addition to the index of the cell, ``cellIdx``, the
     supplied kernel takes two additional arguments:

      a. ``coords``, a matrix that stores the node coordinates of the cell, and
      b. ``nodeIds``, an array that stores the IDs of the constituent cell nodes.

The cell node coordinates matrix, defined by ``axom::numerics::Matrix`` is
organized such that:

  * The number of rows of the matrix corresponds to the cell dimension, and,
  * The number of columns of the matrix corresponds to the number of cell nodes.
  * The :math:`ith` column vector of the matrix stores the coordinates of the
    :math:`ith` cell node.

In this example, the 2D :ref:`UniformMesh`, consists of 2D rectangular cells,
which are defined by :math:`4` nodes. Consequently, the supplied node coordinates
matrix to the kernel, ``coords``, will be a :math:`2 \times 4` matrix of the
following form:

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \[ \left(
   \begin{array}{ c c c c }
      x_0 & x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\
      y_0 & y_1 & y_2 & y_3
   \end{array}
   \right) \]

Within the body of the kernel, the centroid of the cell is calculated by
averaging the node coordinates. The code loops over the columns of the
``coords`` matrix (i.e., the cell nodes) and computes the sum of each
node coordinate in ``xsum`` and ``ysum`` respectively. Then, the average is
evaluated by multiplying each coordinate sum with :math:`1/N`, where :math:`N`
is the number of nodes of a cell. The result is stored in the corresponding
field array, ``xc``, which is captured by the `Lambda Expression`_.

Since, the cell centroid is a 2D vector quantity, each cell entry has an
x-component and y-component. Multi-component fields in Mint are stored using a
2D row-major contiguous memory layout, where, the number of rows corresponds to
the number of cells, and the number of columns correspond to the number of
components of the field. Consequently, the x-component of the centroid of a cell
with ID, ``cellIdx`` is stored at ``xc[ cellIIdx * NUM_COMPONENTS  ]`` and the
y-component is stored at ``xc[ cellIdx * NUM_COMPONENTS + 1 ]``, where
``NUM_COMPONENTS=2``.

In addition, the node-centered quantity, ``phi``, computed in :ref:`step4` is
averaged and stored at the cell centers. The kernel first sums all the nodal
contributions in ``hsum`` and then multiplies by :math:`1/N`, where :math:`N`
is the number of nodes of a cell.

See the :ref:`sections/tutorial` for more details on using the
:ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` of the :ref:`sections/execution_model`.

.. _step6:

Step 6: Output the Mesh in VTK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Last, the resulting mesh and data can be output in the Legacy `VTK File Format`_,
which can be visualized by a variety of visualization tools, such as `VisIt`_
and `ParaView`_ as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/user_guide/mint_getting_started.cpp
   :start-after: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_vtk_start
   :end-before: sphinx_tutorial_walkthrough_vtk_end
   :language: C++
   :linenos:

A VTK file corresponding to the `VTK File Format`_ specification for the mesh
type used will be generated.

.. _step7:

Step 7: Run the Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After building the `Axom Toolkit`_, the basic Mint example may be run
from within the build space directory as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   > ./examples/mint_getting_started_ex

By default the example will use a :math:`25 \times 25` :ref:`UniformMesh` domain
defined on the interval :math:`\mathcal{I}:[-5.0,5.0] \times [-5.0,5.0]`.
The resulting VTK file is stored in the specified file, ``uniform_mesh.vtk``.
A depiction of the mesh showing a plot of `Himmelblau's Function`_ computed
over the constituent :ref:`Nodes` of the mesh is illustrated in
:numref:`figs/intro_mesh`.

.. _figs/intro_mesh:
.. figure:: ../figures/intro_mesh.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Resulting Uniform mesh

   Plot of `Himmelblau's Function`_ computed over the constituent :ref:`Nodes`
   of the :ref:`UniformMesh`.


The user may choose to use an :ref:`UnstructuredMesh` instead by specifying
the ``--unstructured`` option at the command line as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   > ./examples/mint_getting_started_ex --unstructured

The code will generate an :ref:`UnstructuredMesh` by triangulating the
:ref:`UniformMesh` such that each quadrilateral is subdivided into four triangles.
The resulting unstructured mesh is stored in a VTK file, ``unstructured_mesh.vtk``,
depicted in :numref:`figs/intro_mesh_unstructured`.

.. _figs/intro_mesh_unstructured:
.. figure:: ../figures/intro_mesh_unstructured.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Resulting Unstructured mesh

   Plot of `Himmelblau's Function`_ computed over the constituent :ref:`Nodes`
   of the :ref:`UnstructuredMesh`.

By default the resolution of the mesh is set to :math:`25 \times 25`. A user
may set the desired resolution to use at the command line, using the
``--resolution [N]`` command line option.

For example, the following indicates that a mesh of resolution
:math:`100 \times 100` will be used instead when running the example.

.. code-block:: bash

   > ./examples/mint_getting_started_ex --resolution 100


.. note::

   This example is designed to run:

   * In parallel on the GPU when the `Axom Toolkit`_ is compiled
     with `RAJA`_ and CUDA enabled.
   * In parallel on the CPU when the `Axom Toolkit`_ is compiled
     with `RAJA`_ and OpenMP enabled.
   * Sequentially on the CPU, otherwise.
