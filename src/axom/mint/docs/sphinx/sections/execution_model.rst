Execution Model
----------------

Mint provides a mesh-aware :ref:`sections/execution_model`,
based on the `RAJA`_ programming model abstraction layer. The
execution model supports on-node fine-grain parallelism for mesh traversals.
Thereby, enable the implementation of computational kernels that are born parallel
and portable across different processor architectures.

.. note::
   To utilize NVIDIA GPUs, using the `RAJA`_ CUDA backend, Axom needs to be
   compiled with CUDA support and linked to a CUDA-enabled `RAJA`_ library.
   Consult the `Axom Quick Start Guide`_ for more information.

The execution model consists of a set of templated functions that accept
two arguments:

#. A pointer to a mesh object corresponding to one of the supported
   :ref:`MeshTypes`.

#. The *kernel* that defines the operations on the supplied mesh, which is
   usually specified by a C++11 `Lambda Expression`.

.. note::

  Instead of a C++11 `Lambda Expression`_ a C++ functor may also be used
  to encapsulate a kernel. However, in our experience, using C++11 functors,
  usually requires more boiler plate code, which reduces readability and may
  potentially have a negative impact on performance.

The :ref:`sections/execution_model` provides :ref:`NodeTraversalFunctions`,
:ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` and :ref:`FaceTraversalFunctions` to iterate and
operate on the constituent :ref:`Nodes`, :ref:`Cells` and :ref:`Faces` of the
mesh respectively. The general form of these functions is shown
in :numref:`figs/execModel`.

   General form of the constituent templated functions of the
   :ref:`sections/execution_model`

As shown in :numref:`figs/execModel`, the key elements of the functions
that comprise the :ref:`sections/execution_model` are:

* **The Iteration Space:** Indicated by the function suffix, used to
  specify the mesh entities to traverse and operate upon, e.g. the
  :ref:`Nodes`, :ref:`Cells` or :ref:`Faces` of the mesh.

* The :ref:`executionPolicy`: Specified as as the first, *required*, template
  argument to the constituent functions of the :ref:`sections/execution_model`.
  The :ref:`executionPolicy` specifies *where* and *how* the kernel is executed.

* The :ref:`executionSignature`: Specified by a second, *optional*, template
  argument to the constituent functions of the :ref:`sections/execution_model`.
  The :ref:`executionSignature` specifies the type of arguments supplied to
  a given *kernel*.

* **The Kernel:** Supplied as an argument to the constituent functions of the
  :ref:`sections/execution_model`. It defines the body of operations
  performed on the supplied mesh.

See the :ref:`sections/tutorial` for code snippets that illustrate how to use
the :ref:`NodeTraversalFunctions`, :ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` and
:ref:`FaceTraversalFunctions` of the :ref:`sections/execution_model`.

.. _executionPolicy:

Execution Policy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`ExecutionPolicy` is specifed as the first template argument and is
required by all of the constituent functions of the
:ref:`sections/execution_model`. Axom defines a set of high-level execution
spaces, summarized in the table below.

+------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Execution Policy                   |     Requirements               |          Description            |
|                                    |                                |                                 |
+====================================+================================+=================================+
| **SEQ_EXEC**                       |    None.                       | Sequential execution on         |
|                                    |                                | the CPU.                        |
+------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| **OMP_EXEC**                       |  `RAJA`_ + OpenMP              | Parallel execution on           |
|                                    |                                | the CPU using OpenMP.           |
+------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| **CUDA_EXEC< BLOCKSIZE >**         |  `RAJA`_ + CUDA +              | Parallel execution on           |
|                                    |  `Umpire`_ (memory management) | CUDA-enabled GPUs.              |
+------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| **CUDA_EXEC< BLOCKSIZE, ASYNC >**  |  `RAJA`_ + CUDA +              | Asynchronous parallel           |
|                                    |  `Umpire`_ (memory management) | execution on CUDA-enabled GPUs. |
+------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+

Internally, the implementation uses the ``axom::execution_space`` traits object
to map each execution space to corresponding `RAJA`_ execution policies and
bind the default memory space for a given execution space. For example, the
default memory space for the ``axom::CUDA_EXEC`` execution space is unified
memory, which can be accessed from both the host (CPU ) and device (GPU).

.. _executionSignature:

Execution Signature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`executionSignature` is specified as the second, *optional* template
argument to the constituent functions of the :ref:`sections/execution_model`.
The :ref:`executionSignature` indicates the list of arguments that are
supplied to the user-specified kernel.

.. note::

    If not specified, the default :ref:`executionSignature` is set to
    ``mint::xargs::index``, which indicates that the supplied kernel takes
    a single argument that corresponds to the index of the corresponding
    iteration space, i.e, the loop index.

The list of currently available :ref:`executionSignature` options is based on
commonly employed access patterns found in various mesh processing and numerical
kernels. However, the :ref:`sections/execution_model` is designed such that it
can be extended to accomodate additional access patterns.

* ``mint::xargs::index``
   * Default :ref:`ExecutionSignature` to all functions of the
     :ref:`sections/execution_model`
   * Indicates that the supplied kernel takes a single argument that corresponds
     to the index of the iteration space, i.e. the loop index.

* ``mint::xargs::ij``/``mint::xargs::ijk``
   * Applicable only with a :ref:`StructuredMesh`.
   * Used with :ref:`NodeTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_nodes()``)
     and :ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_cells()``).
   * Indicates that the supplied kernel takes the corresonding :math:`(i,j)`
     or :math:`(i,j,k)` indices, in 2D or 3D respectively, as additional arguments.

* ``mint::xargs::x``/``mint::xargs::xy``/``mint::xargs::xyz``
   * Used with :ref:`NodeTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_nodes()``).
   * Indicates that the supplied kernel takes the corresponding nodal
     coordinates, :math:`x` in 1D, :math:`(x,y)` in 2D and :math:`(x,y,z)`
     in 3D, in addition to the corresponding node index, ``nodeIdx``.

* ``mint::xargs::nodeids``
   * Used with :ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_cells()``)
     and :ref:`FaceTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_faces()``).
   * Indicates that the specified kernel is supplied the constituent node IDs
     as an array argument to the kernel.

* ``mint::xargs::coords``
   * Used with :ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_cells()``).
     and :ref:`FaceTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_faces()``)
   * Indicates that the specified kernel is supplied the constituent
     node IDs and corresponding coordinates as arguments to the kernel.

* ``mint::xargs::faceids``
   * Used with the :ref:`CellTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_cells()``).
   * Indicates that the specified kernel is supplied an array consisting of
     the constituent cell face IDs as an additional argument.

* ``mint::xargs::cellids``
   * Used with the :ref:`FaceTraversalFunctions` (``mint::for_all_faces()``).
   * Indicates that the specified kernel is supplied the ID of the two abutting
     :ref:`Cells` to the given. By conventions, tor *external* *boundary*
     :ref:`Faces`, that are bound to a single cell, the second cell is set
     to :math:`-1`.

.. warning::

   Calling a traversal function with an unsupported :ref:`executionSignature`
   will result in a compile time error.
