 * \class RectilinearMesh
 *
 * \brief Provides the ability to represent and operate on a structured
 *  rectilinear mesh.
 *
 * The RectilinearMesh object extends the StructuredMesh base class and adds
 * the ability to represent and operate on structured, rectilinear meshes.
 *
 * A <em> RectilinearMesh </em> divides the solution domain in nodes and cells
 * that are arranged on a regular lattice that is axis-aligned with the
 * Cartesian coordinate axes. Consequently, the cells are always rectangular.
 * Due to the regular topology, each node/cell on the mesh can be uniquely
 * identified by a corresponding logical i-j-k index. However, the nodal
 * coordinates along each axis are explicitly defined and may have variable
 * spacing in between them. Given a logical i-j-k index of a node, the physical
 * coordinates of the corresponding node can be evaluated by taking the
 * Cartesian product of the corresponding coordinate along each direction. For
 * that reason, <em> rectilinear </em> meshes are also often called product
 * meshes.
 *
 * A <em> RectilinearMesh </em> object may be constructed using (a) a native
 * constructor, (b) an external constructor, or (c) Sidre, when Mint is
 * compiled with Sidre support.
 *
 * * <b> Native Constructor </b>
 *
 *   When using native storage, the RectilinearMesh object owns all associated
 *   memory. Once the object is deleted, all memory is returned to the system.
 *
 * * <b> External Constructor </b>
 *
 *   A RectilinearMesh may also be constructed from externally supplied
 *   coordinate buffers. In this case, the callind code owns the memory and is
 *   responsible for properly deallocating the supplied buffers.
 *
 * * <b> Sidre Constructor </b>
 *
 *   A RectilinearMesh may also be constructed and be associated with a
 *   sidre::Group. In this case, all memory is managed by Sidre. Once the
 *   object goes out-of-scope the data remains persistent in Sidre. Last,
 *   the data is stored in Sidre according to the conventions described in the
 *   <a href="http://llnl-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"> computational
 *   mesh blueprint </a>.
