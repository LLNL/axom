/*! \brief Record a Mesh's face-to-cell, cell-to-face, and face-to-node
 *         relations.
 *
 * \param [in] m pointer to a Mesh.
 * \param [out] facecount the number of unique faces of m's cells.
 * \param [out] f2c the relation between face f and its two incident cells
 *              with cellIDs at f2c[2*f] and f2c[2*f+1].
 * \param [out] c2f the relation between cell c and its n faces with faceIDs
 *              stored contiguously starting at c2f[c2foffsets[c]].
 * \param [out] c2n the relation between cell c and its n neighbors with
 *              cellIDs stored contiguously starting at c2n[c2foffsets[c]].
 * \param [out] c2foffsets the offset in c2f of the first face of each cell.
 * \param [out] f2n the relation between face f and its nodes stored
 *              contiguously starting at f2n[f2noffsets[f]].
 * \param [out] f2noffsets the offset in f2n of the first node of each face.
 * \param [out] f2ntypes the CellType of each face.
 *
 * \returns success true if each face has one or two incident cells.
 *
 * \note The seven output arrays f2c, c2f, c2n, c2foffsets, f2n, f2noffsets,
 * and f2ntypes are allocated in this routine if the routine is successful.
 * It is the caller's responsibility to free this memory.  If the routine
 * returns false, the output arrays are set to nullptr and facecount is set
 * to 0.
 *
 * This routine visits each of the cells of the mesh.  For each cell face, it
 * retrieves the face's nodes and joins the sorted node IDs to make a unique
 * hash key.  The incident cells are recorded in a list for each face's hash
 * key.  The final face-cell and cell-face relations are constructed from this
 * data structure.
 *
 * This routine is intended to be used in constructing an UnstructuredMesh's
 * face relations, though it will give correct results for any Mesh.
