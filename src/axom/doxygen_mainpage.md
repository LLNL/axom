Axom {#mainpage}
================

Axom provides libraries that address common computer science needs.  It grew from the recognition that physics codes at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories had encountered the need for logging, a data store, geometric computation, file I/O, and other facilities and had addressed the needs in various idiosyncratic methods.  Axom is designed to provide a drop-in replacement for code that wants to adopt it.

# Axom components

* @subpage coretop provides shared utility functionality to all components.
* @subpage inlettop provides input file functionality.
* @subpage kleetop provides functionality to add non-conformal material regions to meshes.
* @subpage lumberjacktop provides logging aggregation and filtering capability.
* @subpage minttop provides a comprehensive mesh data model.
* @subpage mirtop provides algorithms for material interface reconstruction on multimaterial meshes.
* @subpage multimattop provides an API for managing multimaterial field data.
* @subpage primaltop provides an API for geometric primitives and computational geometry tests.
* @subpage questtop provides an API to query point distance and position relative to meshes.
* @subpage sidretop provides a data store with hierarchical structure.
* @subpage sinatop ([S]imulation [In]sight and [A]nalysis) unified output library collects data directly within codes, outputting them to a common file output format co-designed with application developers and users.
* @subpage slamtop provides an API to construct and process meshes.
* @subpage slictop provides infrastructure for logging application messages.
* @subpage spintop provides spatial acceleration data structures, also known as spatial indexes.

Dependencies between components are as follows:
- Core, Slic, and Lumberjack provide basic services to the rest of Axom and to user code 
  - Core has no dependencies, and the other modules depend on Core
  - Slic optionally depends on Lumberjack
- Slam, Primal, Sidre, Spin, Inlet, Mint, Mir, Klee, Multimat and Quest all depend on Slic and Core
  - Inlet depends on Sidre and Primal
  - Mint depends on Slam, and optionally Sidre
  - Mir depends on Slic, Slam, and Primal
  - Spin depends on Primal and Slam
  - Quest depends on Slam, Primal, Spin, and Mint
  - Klee depends on Sidre, Inlet and Primal
  - Multimat depends on Slic, and Slam
  - Sina only depends on Core

The figure below summarizes the dependencies between the modules.  Solid links
indicate hard dependencies; dashed links indicate optional dependencies.

Each component contains a `test` subdirectory containing numerous code unit tests and an `example` subdirectory with more extensive demonstrations of the Axom library.  The Sidre, Mint, and Slam examples include several versions of the `lulesh` mini-app,  an implementation of the heat equation and a 1-D shock tube simulation.
