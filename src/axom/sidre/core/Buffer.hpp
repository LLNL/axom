 * \class Buffer
 *
 * \brief Buffer is a container that describes and holds data in memory.
 *
 * The Buffer class has the following properties:
 *
 *    - Buffer objects can only be created using the DataStore
 *      createBuffer() methods. The Buffer ctor is private.
 *    - A Buffer object has a unique identifier within a DataStore,
 *      which is assigned by the DataStore when the Buffer is created.
 *    - The data owned by a Buffer is unique to that Buffer
 *      object; i.e.,  Buffers do not share their data.
 *    - Typical usage is to describe the data a Buffer will hold and then
 *      allocate it by calling one of the Buffer allocate or
 *      reallocate methods.
 *    - A Buffer object maintains a collection of Views that
 *      refer to its data. These references are created when a Buffer
 *      object is attached to a View.
