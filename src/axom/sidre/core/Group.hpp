/*!
 * \class Group
 *
 * \brief Group holds a collection of Views and (child) Groups.
 *
 * The Group class has the following properties:
 *
 *    - Groups can be organized into a (tree) hierarchy by creating
 *      child Groups from the root Group owned by a DataStore object.
 *    - A Group object can only be created by another Group; the
 *      Group ctor is not visible externally. A Group is owned
 *      by the Group that creates it (its parent) and becomes a
 *      (direct) child Group of the parent. Groups in the subtree
 *      rooted at an ancestor Group are that Group's descendants.
 *    - A Group object has a unique name (string) within its parent
 *      Group.
 *    - A Group object maintains a pointer to its parent Group.
 *    - A Group object can be moved or copied to another Group.
 *    - Group objects can create View objects within them. The
 *      Group that creates a View owns it.
 *    - A View object has a unique name (string) within the Group
 *      that owns it.
 *    - A View object can be moved or copied to another Group.
 *
 * Note that Views and child Groups within a Group can be accessed
 * by name or index.
 *
 * Note that certain methods for querying, creating, retrieving, and
 * deleting Groups and Views take a string with path syntax,
 * while others take the name of a direct child of the current Group.
 * Methods that require the name of a direct child are marked with
 * "Child", for example hasChildView() and hasChildGroup().  When a path
 * string is passed to a method that accepts path syntax, the last item in
 * the path indicates the item to be created, accessed, etc.  For example,
 *
 *      View* view = group->createView("foo/bar/baz");
 *
 * is equivalent to
 *
 *      View* view =
 *        group->createGroup("foo")->createGroup("bar")->createView("baz");
 *
 * In particular, intermediate Groups "foo" and "bar" will be created in
 * this case if they don't already exist.
 *
 * Methods that access Views or Groups by index work with the direct
 * children of the current Group because an index has no meaning outside
 * of the indexed group.  None of these methods is marked with "Child".
 *
 * A Group can optionally be created to hold items in a "list format". In
 * this format, any number of child Group or View items can be created to
 * be held and accessed like a list.  When using this format, the child items
 * can be accessed only via iterators that iterate in the order that they
 * were added to the parent Group.
 *
 * It is recommended but not required that the items held in the list format
 * be created without names.  String names may be assigned to these items,
 * but the names will not be useful for accessing them from their parent
 * Group, and none of the methods that access child items by name or path will
 * return a valid pointer.  Additionally, strings with path syntax, (such
 * as ("foo/bar/baz") will be considered invalid when creating items to be
 * held in the list format, and the object creation methods will return
 * a null pointer if such a string is provided.  Unnamed Groups to be held
 * in the list format should be created using the method createUnnamedGroup,
 * while unnamed Views should be created by passing an empty string as the
 * path argument to any of the createView methods.
 *
 *
 * \attention when Views or Groups are created, destroyed, copied, or moved,
 * indices of other Views and Groups in associated Group objects may
 * become invalid. This is analogous to iterator invalidation for STL
 * containers when the container contents change.
