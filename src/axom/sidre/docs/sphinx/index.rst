Sidre User Guide
================

The Sidre (Simulation data repository) component of Axom provides tools to
centralize data management in HPC applications: data description, allocation, 
access, and so forth. The goal of Sidre is efficient coordination and sharing 
of data: across physics packages in integrated applications, and between 
applications and tools that provide capabilities such as file I/O, *in situ* 
visualization, and analysis.

The design of Sidre is based on substantial experience with current LLNL 
applications and requirements identified for new codes to run on future 
architectures. All of these codes must carefully manage data allocation and 
placement to run efficiently. Related capabilities in existing codes were 
typically developed independently for each code with little regard to sharing. 
In contrast, Sidre is designed from inception to be shared by different 
applications.

Introduction
-------------

Sidre provides simple application-level semantics to describe, 
allocate/deallocate, and provide access to data. Currently supported
capabilities include:

.. Do we want to make keywords bold for each bullet point?

* Separate data description and allocation operations. This allows applications
  to describe their data and then decide how best to place the data in memory.
* Multiple different "views" into a chunk of (shared) data. A Sidre view
  includes description semantics to define data type, number of elements,
  offset, stride, etc. Thus, a chunk of data in memory can be interpreted
  conceptually in different ways using different views into it.
* Externally-owned "opaque" or described data. Sidre can accept a pointer to 
  externally-allocated data and provide access to it by name. When
  external data is described to Sidre, it can be processed in the same ways
  as data that Sidre owns. When data is not described (i.e., it is "opaque"), 
  Sidre can provide access to the data via a pointer, but the consumer of the 
  pointer must know type information to do anything substantial with the data.
* Attributes, or metadata associated with a Sidre view.  This metadata is
  available to user code to facilitate program logic and is also used
  in Axom to enable selective writing data sets to files.
* Tree-structured data hierarchies. Many mesh-based application codes 
  organize data into hierarchies of contexts (e.g., domains, regions, blocks, 
  mesh centerings, subsets of elements containing different materials, etc.). 
  Sidre supports hierarchical, tree-based organizations in a simple, flexible 
  way that aligns with the data organization in many applications.
* APIs for C++, C, and Fortran along with mechanisms to ensure inter-language
  data consistency.

So far, Sidre development has focused on designing and building flexible and
powerful concepts to build on. The Sidre API includes five main concepts:

* **Datastore.** The main access point to data managed by Sidre; it contains 
  a collection of Buffers, a collection of default Attributes, and a tree 
  structure of Groups.
* **Buffer.** Describes and holds a chunk of data in memory owned by Sidre.
* **Group.** Defines a tree structure like a filesystem, where Groups are like
  folders and Views are like files.
* **View.** Describes a conceptual layout of data in memory. Each View
  has a collection of its explicitly-set Attributes.
* **Attribute.** Provides an item of metadata describing a View.

These concepts will be described in more detail in later sections.

At this point, Sidre supports simple data types such as scalars, strings, and 
(multidimensional) arrays of scalars. Fundamentally, Sidre does not preclude 
the use of more complex data structures, but does not currently support them
directly. Future Sidre development will expand core functionality to support
additional features such as:

* Mechanisms to associate data with memory spaces and transfer data between
  spaces.
* Support for more complex data types.
* Complex queries and actions involving Attributes.

Support for these enhancements and others will be added based on application
needs and use cases.
