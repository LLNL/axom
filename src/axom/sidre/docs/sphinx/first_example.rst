An introductory example
******************************************************

As an introduction to the core concepts in Sidre and how they work, here is an
example where we construct the Sidre Datastore shown in the following figure:

The diagram represents a Datastore, which contains all Sidre objects and
provides the main interface to access those objects.
Rounded rectangles represent Sidre Group objects. Each Group has a name and
one parent Group, except for the root Group (i.e. "/") which has no parent.
A Group may have zero or more child Groups (indicated by an
arrow from the parent to each child). The Datastore provides exactly one
root Group (i.e. "/") which is created when a Datastore object is constructed;
thus, an application does not create the root. Each Group also owns zero or 
more View objects, which are shown as rectangles. An arrow points from a Group 
to each View it owns.

A Sidre View object has a name and, typically, some data associated with it.
This example shows various types of data that can be described by a View, 
including scalars, strings, and data in arrays (both externally allocated 
and owned by Sidre Buffer objects). Each array View has a data pointer and 
describes data in terms of data type, number of elements, offset, and stride. 
Data pointers held by array Views are shown as dashed arrows.

A Datastore contains a collection of Buffer objects, shown as segmented
rectangles.

A Datastore contains a list of Attributes. Each Attribute is outlined
with a hexagon and defines a metadata label and a default value associated 
with that label. In this example, the Datastore has Attributes "vis" (with 
default value 0) and "restart" (with default value 1). Default Attributes 
apply to all Views unless explicitly set for individual Views. In this 
example, the Views "temp" and "rho" have the Attribute "vis" set to 1.

Various aspects of Sidre usage are illustrated in the C++ code shown next. 
Sidre provides full C and Fortran APIs that can also be used to generate 
the same result.

First, we create a Datastore object, define some Attributes along with their
default values, and add some child Groups to the root Group.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/sidre_createdatastore.cpp
   :start-after: _first_example_creategroups_start
   :end-before: _first_example_creategroups_end
   :language: C++

The ``Group::createViewScalar()`` method lets an application store scalar 
values in Views owned by a Group.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/sidre_createdatastore.cpp
   :start-after: _first_example_state_start
   :end-before: _first_example_state_end
   :language: C++

This example stores (x, y, z) node position data in one array.
The array is managed through a Buffer object and three Views point into it.
C++ Sidre operations that create Buffers, Groups, and Views, as shown in the
following code, return a pointer to the object that is created. This allows 
chaining operations. (Chaining is supported in the C++ API but not in C or 
Fortran.)

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/sidre_createdatastore.cpp
   :start-after: _first_example_nodes_start
   :end-before: _first_example_nodes_end
   :language: C++

The last two integral arguments to the 'createView()' method specify the
offset from the beginning of the array and the stride of the data. Thus,
the x, y, z values for each position are stored contiguously with the
x values, y values, and z values each offset from each other by a stride of
three in the array. 

The next snippet creates two views ("temp" and "rho") and allocates each of
their data as an array of type double with length 'eltcount'. Then, it sets 
an Attribute ("vis") on each of those Views with a value of 1. Lastly, it 
creates a Group ("ext") that has a View that holds an external pointer 
("region"). The 'apply()' method describes the View data as an array of
integer type and length 'eltcount'. Note that it is the responsibility of
the caller to ensure that the allocation to which the "region" pointer 
references is adequate to contain that data description.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/sidre_createdatastore.cpp
   :start-after: _first_example_fields_start
   :end-before: _first_example_fields_end
   :language: C++

The next code example shows various methods to retrieve Groups and data out 
of Views in the Group hierarchy.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/sidre_createdatastore.cpp
   :start-after: _first_example_access_start
   :end-before: _first_example_access_end
   :language: C++

In the last section, the code accesses the arrays associated with the views 
"y", "temp", and "region". While "temp" and "region" have the default offset 
(0) and stride (1), "y" has offset 1 and stride 3 (as described earlier). 
The pointer returned by ``View::getPointer()`` always points to the first 
data element described by the View (the View takes care of the offset),
but use of a stride other than 1 must be done by the code itself.

Unix-style path syntax using the slash ("/") delimiter is supported for
traversing Sidre Group and View hierarchies and accessing their contents.
However, '..' and '.' syntax (up-directory and current directory) is not
supported. This usage is shown in the last call to ``getView()`` in the code 
example above. The method call retrieves the View named "region" in the Group 
"ext" that is a child of the "fields" Group. Character sequences before the 
first slash and between two consecutive slashes are assumed to be Group names 
(describing parent-child relationships). For this method, and others dealing 
with Views, the sequence following the last slash is assumed to be the name of 
a View. Similar path syntax can be used to retrieve Groups, create Groups and 
Views, and so forth.
