   * parameter is provided as a string ending in ".root", that string will be

   * name will be the file_base string with the ".root" suffix removed from
   * its end.

   * \brief write a Conduit Blueprint index to an existing root file
   *
   * Given a domain that adheres to Conduit's Blueprint format, this method
   * generates a Blueprint index and writes it to an existing root file.
   *
   * The domain must be stored in a Group located at the path in the
   * DataStore specified by domain_path argument.
   *
   * This currently only works if the root file was created for protocol
   * sidre_hdf5.  This must be called after calling write().
   *
   * The parameters domain_path and mesh_path are related. domain_path is the
   * path from the root of the DataStore to the domain that is being used to
   * generate the index.  mesh_path is the path from the group that was
   * passed into the preceding write() call to the same domain.  If write()
   * was called using the root group of the DataStore, then domain_path and
   * mesh_path will be identical.  Otherwise mesh_path is a sub-path of
   * domain_path.
   *
   * For example, the DataStore may contain a hierarchy of data that looks
   * like this, and we want to generate a blueprint index based on the mesh
   * located at "/hierarchy/domain_data/domain/blueprint_mesh":
   *
   * <root>
   * |--hierarchy
   * |  |--domain_data
   * |     |--domain
   * |     |  |--blueprint_mesh
   * |     |     |--coordsets
   * |     |     |  |--...
   * |     |     |--topologies
   * |     |     |  |--...
   * |     |     |--fields
   * |     |        |--...
   * |     |--...
   * |--
   *
   * If write() is called using the Group located at "/hierarchy/domain_data",
   * then only the Groups and Views descending from that Group are written
   * to the file.  To call this method, we would choose the full path in
   * the DataStore "hierarchy/domain_data/domain/blueprint_mesh" for
   * domain_path.  For the mesh_path argument, we choose only the path that
   * exists in the file:  "domain/blueprint_mesh".
   *
   * This is not an MPI collective call.  One rank writes a blueprint index
   * to one root file.
   *
   * \param datastore     DataStore containing Groups that hold domains
   *                      that adhere to the Blueprint format

   *                      used to generate a Blueprint index
