Spin User Guide
===============

The Spin component of Axom provides several index data structures to accelerate
spatial queries.  The Morton code classes relate each point in a region of
interest to a point on a one-dimensional space filling curve, and the
RectangularLattice helps in the computation of bin coordinates.  The UniformGrid
and ImplicitGrid classes build one-level indexes of non-intersecting bins, while
the BVHTree and SpatialOctree classes build nesting hierarchies of bounding
boxes indexing a region of interest.
