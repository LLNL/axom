Core Concepts

Sina provides four main classes:

    - ``Document`` - represents the top-level object of a JSON file conforming to the Sina schema.
    - ``Record`` - represents the data to be stored.
    - ``Relationship`` - represents a way to define the relationship between two ``Record`` objects.
    - ``CurveSet`` - a class to store related independent and dependent ``Curve`` objects. \
      ``Curve`` and ``CurveSet`` objects are just two more types of data that ``Record`` objects can store.

More details on each class can be found in their respective pages below.
