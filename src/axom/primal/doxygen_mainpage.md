Primal {#primaltop}
========

[Primal](@ref axom::primal) provides classes representing geometric primitives (such as [points](@ref axom::primal::Point), [bounding boxes](@ref axom::primal::BoundingBox), and [triangles](@ref axom::primal::BoundingBox)) and functions implementing computational geometry tests (such as intersect(), squared_distance(), orientation()).

It also provides spatial acceleration data structures over collections of spatial objects, including the [bounding volume hierarchy](@ref axom::primal::BVHTree) tree and the [uniform grid](@ref axom::primal::UniformGrid) (also known as cell list).
