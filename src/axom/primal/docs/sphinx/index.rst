Primal User Guide
=================

Primal is a component of Axom that provides efficient and general purpose
algorithms and data structures for computational geometry.  Primal provides:

- Classes to represent geometric primitives such as Point and Ray
- Functions operating on Primal's classes to implement geometric operators,
  including distance and intersection

This tutorial contains a collection of brief examples demonstrating
Primal primitives and operators.  The examples instantiate geometric primitives
as needed and demonstrate geometric operators.  These examples also show
representative overloads of each of the Primal operators (see the
`API documentation <../../../../doxygen/html/primaltop.html>`_ 
for more details).
