Core utilities
******************************************************

The `axom::utilities` namespace contains basic useful functions.  Often
these have started out in another, higher-level library and proven so
useful they're "promoted" to Axom Core.  In some cases, `axom::utilities`
brings functionality from recent standards of C++ to platforms restricted
to older compilers.

(example code showing off Timer, LexiComparator, filesystem, string,
and some math calls)
