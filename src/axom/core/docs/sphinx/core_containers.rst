Core containers
******************************************************

.. warning::
   Axom's containers are currently the target of a refactoring effort. The following
   information is subject to change, as are the interfaces for the containers themselves.

Axom Core contains the Array, MCArray, and StackArray classes.  Among other things, these
data containers facilitate porting code that uses `std::vector` to the GPU.

Array is a multidimensional contiguous container template.  In the 1-dimensional case,
this class will behave like std::vector.  In higher dimensions some vector-like
functionality will be unavailable, e.g., ``push_back``, and multidimensional-specific
operations will mirror the ``ndarray`` provided by ``numpy`` when possible.
In the future, it will be possible to take "views" of the underlying array data that
allow for flexible reinterpretation via different striding.

MCArray (or Multi-Component Array) is a container template for a contiguous array of tuples.
In this sense it can be thought of as a two-dimensional array.  MCArray will be removed
imminently as Array provides/will provide this multidimensional functionality.

Here's an example showing how to use MCArray instead of `std::vector`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/core_containers.cpp
   :start-after: _arraybasic_start
   :end-before: _arraybasic_end
   :language: C++

Applications commonly store tuples of data in a flat array or a `std::vector`.
The MCArray class formalizes tuple storage, as shown in the next example.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/core_containers.cpp
   :start-after: _arraytuple_start
   :end-before: _arraytuple_end
   :language: C++

The MCArray class can use an external memory buffer, with the restriction that 
operations that would cause the buffer to resize are not permitted.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/core_containers.cpp
   :start-after: _extbuffer_start
   :end-before: _extbuffer_end
   :language: C++

Similar to `std::vector`, when using an internal array the Array and MCArray classes can
reserve memory in anticipation of future growth as well as shrink to just the
memory currently in use.

The StackArray class is a work-around for a limitation in the nvcc compiler,
which can't capture arrays on the stack in device lambdas.  More details are in
the API documentation and in the tests.
