Axom Core User Guide
====================

The Axom Core component provides fundamental data structures and operations used
throughout Axom.  Different compilers and platforms support these essential 
building blocks in various ways; the Core library provides a uniform interface.

Axom Core contains numeric limits and a matrix representation with operators in
the ``axom::numerics`` namespace.  It contains various utilities including a 
timer class, lexical comparator class, ``processAbort()`` function, and numeric,
filesystem, and string manipulation utilities in the ``axom::utilities``
namespace.  Axom Core also contains the ``axom::Array`` and ``axom::StackArray``
container classes.

.. note:: The Core library does not depend on any other Axom components/libraries. In particular, Core does not use macros from the Axom Slic library for output.
