 * \brief For a cubic equation of the form \f$ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \f$,
 * find real roots.
 *
 * A closed-form solution for cubic equations was published in Cardano's
 * *Ars Magna* of 1545.  This can be summarized as follows:
 *
 * Start with the cubic equation
 *
 *   \f[ ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0. \f]
 *
 * Divide through by a to normalize, then define the following:
 *
 *   \f[ p = b^2 - 3c \f]
 *   \f[ q = -\frac{27}{2}d - b^3 + \frac{9}{2}cb \f]
 *   \f[ t = 2p^{-3/2}q \f]
 *   \f[ y = \frac{3}{\sqrt{p}}(x + \frac{1}{3}b) \f]
 *
 * Then the original cubic equation can be written as \f$ y^3 - 3y = t \f$
 * with a solution \f$ y = \frac{1}{u} + u \f$, with
 *
 *   \f[ u = \sqrt[3]{\frac{t}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{t^2}{4} - 1}}. \f]
 *
 * Because the cubic is an odd function, there can be either one, two, or
 * three distinct real roots.  If there is one distinct real root, the root
 * can either have multiplicity 3, or have multiplicity 1 with two complex
 * roots.  In the case of two real roots, one root will have multiplicity 2.
 * If the discriminant \f$ d = -27t^2 - 4(-3^3) \f$ is zero, the equation has
 * at least one root with multiplicity greater than 1.  If \f$ d > 0, \f$
 * there are three distinct real roots, and if \f$ d > 0, \f$ there is one
 * real root.

 * Engineers," QA37 K84 1968 in the library; section 1.8-3 "Cubic Equations",

 *
 * \param [in] coeff Equation coefficients: coeff[i] multiplies \f$ x^i \f$.
