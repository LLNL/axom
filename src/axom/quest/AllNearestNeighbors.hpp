/*!
 * \brief Given a list of point locations and regions, for each point, find
 *   the closest point in a different region within a given search radius.
 * \param [in] x X-coordinates of input points
 * \param [in] y Y-coordinates of input points
 * \param [in] z Z-coordinates of input points
 * \param [in] region Region of each point
 * \param [in] n Number of points
 * \param [in] limit Max distance for all-nearest-neighbors query
 * \param [out] neighbor Index of nearest neighbor not in the same class
 *    (or NEIGHBOR_NOT_FOUND)
 * \param [out] sqdistance Squared distance to nearest neighbor
 * \pre x, y, z, and region have n entries
 * \pre neighbor is allocated with room for n entries
 *
 * This method inserts all points p at (x[i], y[i], z[i]) into a UniformGrid
 * index. Then for each point p, it gets the UniformGrid bins that overlap
 * the box (p - (limit, limit, limit), p + (limit, limit, limit).  The method
 * compares p to each point in this list of bins and returns the index of the
 * closest point.
 *
 * We expect the use of the UniformGrid  will result in a substantial time
 * savings over a brute-force all-to-all algorithm, but the query's run time
 * is dependent on the point distribution.
