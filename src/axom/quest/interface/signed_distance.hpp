 * \brief The Signed Distance Query evaluates the signed distance function,
 *  \f$ \phi \f$, at an arbitrary point, \f$ \vec{p} \f$, with respect to an
 *  oriented surface, \f$ \mathcal S\f$
 *
 *  Given a discrete representation of the surface, i.e., a surface mesh, that
 *  is oriented according to an outward-facing unit normal, the signed distance
 *  function, \f$ \phi(\vec{p}) \f$, evaluated at a point, \f$ \vec{p} \f$, is
 *  defined such that:
 *  \f{equation}{
 *    \phi( \vec{p} ) =
 *      \begin{cases}
 *        +d,   & \vec{p} \mbox{ is in front of the surface, } \mathcal{S}  \\
 *        \pm0, & \vec{p} \mbox{ is on the boundary, } \partial\mathcal{S}  \\
 *        -d,   & \vec{p} \mbox{ is behind the surface, } \mathcal{S}
 *       \end{cases}
 *  \f}
 *
 *  \warning Currently, the Signed Distance Query supports:
 *    * reading in surface meshes given in the
 *      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)">STL format</a>
 *    * oriented 3D triangular surface meshes
 *
 * <b> Usage Example: </b>
 * \code
 *
 *  int main( int argc, char** argv )
 *  {
 *    MPI_Init( &argc, &argv );
 *    MPI_Comm mpi_comm = MPI_COMM_WORLD;
 *    ...
 *    // STEP 0: set parameters
 *    quest::signed_distance_set_dimension( 3 );
 *    quest::signed_distance_set_max_levels( 25 );
 *    quest::signed_distance_set_max_occupancy( 5 );
 *
 *    // STEP 1: initialize
 *    quest::signed_distance_init( "path/to/stlmesh.stl", mpi_comm );
 *
 *    // STEP 2: evaluate the signed distance at N query points
 *    for ( int i=0; i < N; ++i )
 *    {
 *       ...
 *       phi[ i ] = quest::signed_distance_evaluate( x[i], y[i], z[i] );
 *
 *    } // END for all N query points
 *
 *    // STEP 3: Finalize
 *    quest::signed_distance_finalize( );
 *
 *    MPI_Finalize( );
