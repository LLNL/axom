 * This function creates a new Mint mesh out of an array of Octahedron objects.
 * The mesh will be valid for any oct array, but the fields it includes make sense
 * for the output of discretizing a revolved polyline:
 *  - octahedron_volume: octahedron volume calculated by summing tetrahedron volumes.
 *  - oct_as_polyhedron_volume: octahedron volume calculated by changing the oct
 *    into a Polyhedron and reporting the Polyhedron's volume.  Any discrepancy
 *    between this field and octahedron_volume is a bug.
 *  - segment_index: the zero-based index of the segment to which the parent
 *    octahedron belongs.
 *  - octahedron_index: the zero-based index of the parent octahedron within its
 *    segment.
 *  - level_of_refinement: the level of refinement to which parent octahedron belongs.
 *
 * \note Ownership of the mesh object is passed to the caller. Consequently,
 *  the caller is responsible for properly deallocating the mesh object that
 *  the return mesh pointer points to.
