/* Discretize a cylinder (or truncated cone) into a hierarchy of
 * triangular prisms (or truncated tetrahedra) stored as octahedra.
 * Each level of refinement places a new prism/tet on all exposed faces.
 *
 * Input:  2D points a and b, number of levels of refinement, index into
 * the output array.  The routine assumes a.x <= b.x, a.y >= 0, b.y >= 0.
 * The routine also assumes that the output array is resized to hold
 * the generated prisms at the specified index.
 *
 * Output: the output array of prisms (placed in the output array
 * starting at the index).
 *
 * Return value: the number of prisms generated: zero for degenerate segments,
 * or a value of order 2^(levels) calculated within the routine.
 *
 * Conceptually, end points a and b are revolved around the X-axis, describing
 * circles that are the truncated cone's end-caps.  The segment ab revolved
 * about the X-axis becomes the side-wall.
 *
 * The level-zero prism is constructed by inscribing a triangle in each of the
 * end-cap circles.  In one circle, put the points PRT; in the other circle, put
 * the points UQS.  The edges UP, QR, and ST lie in the side-wall described by
 * rotating the segment ab about the x-axis and are each co-planar with the
 * X-axis.  (This five-sided prism, with two end-caps, three side-walls, and six
 * vertices, is stored in an Octahedron data record.  The edges PQ, RS, and TU
 * split the quadrilateral prism side-walls into pairs of coplanar triangles.)
 *
 * Each subsequent level of refinement adds a prism to each exposed
 * quadrilateral side-wall.
