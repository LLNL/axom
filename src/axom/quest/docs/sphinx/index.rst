Quest User Guide
================

The Quest component of Axom provides several spatial operations and queries
on a ``mint::Mesh``.

  - Operations

    - :ref:`Read a surface mesh<reading-mesh>` from an STL file
    - :ref:`Check for some common mesh errors; deduplicate vertices<check-and-repair>`

      - vertex welding: merge vertices closer than a specified distance
        "epsilon"
      - find self-intersections and degenerate triangles in a surface mesh
      - watertightness test: is a surface mesh a watertight manifold?

  - Point queries

    - Surface mesh point queries :ref:`in C<surface-query-c>` or
      :ref:`in C++<surface-query-cpp>`

      - in/out query: is a point inside or outside a surface mesh?
      - signed distance query: find the minimum distance from a query point
        to a surface mesh

    - :ref:`Point in cell query<point-in-cell>`: for a query point, find the
      cell of the mesh that holds the point and the point's isoparametric
      coordinates within that cell
    - :ref:`All nearest neighbors<all-nearest>`: given a list of point
      locations and regions, find all neighbors of each point in a different
      region
