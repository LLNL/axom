Detailed examples
=================

Example 1
=========

Setting up and iterating a relation between two sets
Demonstrates looping through elements using single and double subscript operators as well as iterators.


Example 2
=========

Define a simple hexahedral mesh using Nodes and Zones, relations from nodes to zones and from zones to nodes.
Show how we iterate on the nodes of a zone and on the zones of a node.

This illustrates how different relation types ( static with const and variable cardinality, respectively ) can be
iterated.
