An introductory example
=======================

This file contains an introductory example to define and traverse a simple quadrilateral mesh.
The code for this example can be found in ``axom/src/axom/slam/examples/UserDocs.cpp``.

.. figure:: figs/quad_mesh.png
   :figwidth: 400px
   :alt: A quad mesh with five elements
   :align: center

   An unstructured mesh with eleven vertices (red circles) 
   and five elements (quadrilaterals bounded by black lines)

We first import the unified Slam header, which includes all necessary files for working with Slam:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_import_header_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_import_header_end
   :language: C++


.. note:: All code in slam is in the ``axom::slam`` namespace.
   For convenience, we add the following namespace declaration to our example to allow us
   to directly use the ``slam`` namespace:

   .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
     :start-after: _quadmesh_example_slam_namespace_start
     :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_slam_namespace_end
     :language: C++



Type aliases and variables
==========================


We begin by defining some type aliases for the Sets, Relations and Maps in our mesh.
These type aliases would typically be found in a configuration file or in class header files.

Each Slam type is assembled from policies that describe how it behaves, for example the
cardinality and stride of a relation, or the storage backing a map. 

This follows Slam's central design philosophy: the policies name the design choices for the data structure. Spelling out every policy is always available when you need fine control, but the common
configurations have named shorthands in ``axom/slam/Aliases.hpp`` (:ref:`aliases-label`),
and we use those aliases throughout this example.

We use the following buffer type for the mesh connectivity data.
Slam objects index into their data through a buffer; ``axom::Array`` is Slam's canonical
choice, and it is the default storage for the aliases and helpers used below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_common_typedefs_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_common_typedefs_end
   :language: C++

Sets
----

Our mesh is defined in terms of two sets: Vertices and Elements, whose entities are
referenced by integer-valued indices. Since both sets use a contiguous range of indices
starting from 0, we use ``slam::PositionSet`` to represent them.

We define the following type aliases:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_set_typedefs_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_set_typedefs_end
   :language: C++

and declare them as:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after:  _quadmesh_example_set_variables_start
   :end-before:   _quadmesh_example_set_variables_end
   :language: C++

For other available set types, see :ref:`set-concept-label`.

Relations
---------

We also have relations describing the incidences between the mesh vertices and elements.

The element-to-vertex *boundary* relation encodes the indices of the vertices in the
boundary of each element. Since this is a quad mesh and there are always four vertices in
the boundary of a quadrilateral, its cardinality is a compile-time constant. We use the
``slam::ConstantRelation`` alias, which names the common configuration of a ``StaticRelation``
with a ``ConstantCardinality`` policy, a ``CompileTimeStride`` (here, 4), and ``axom::Array`` storage:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_bdry_relation_typedefs_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_bdry_relation_typedefs_end
   :language: C++

The vertex-to-element *coboundary* relation encodes the indices of all elements incident
in each of the vertices. Since the cardinality of this relation changes for different
vertices, we use the ``slam::VariableRelation`` alias, which names a ``StaticRelation`` with
a ``VariableCardinality`` policy and ``axom::Array`` storage:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_cobdry_relation_typedefs_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_cobdry_relation_typedefs_end
   :language: C++

.. note:: Each alias has a ``*View`` counterpart (``ConstantRelationView``, ``VariableRelationView``)
   that stores ``axom::ArrayView`` values rather than pointers to external
   ``axom::Array`` objects. Both forms borrow their buffers and their sets.
   When a configuration is not covered by an alias, use the  ``StaticRelation`` policies directly.
   See :ref:`aliases-label`.

We declare them as:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_relation_variables_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_relation_variables_end
   :language: C++

For other available set types, see :ref:`relation-concept-label`.

Maps
----

Finally, we have some maps that attach data to our sets.

The following defines a type alias for the positions of the mesh vertices.
It is templated on a point type (``Point2``) that handles simple operations on 2D points.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_maps_typedefs_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_maps_typedefs_end
   :language: C++

The map's values are stored in an ``axom::Array`` that the map allocates and frees itself.
To instead point a map at a buffer whose lifetime is managed elsewhere (for instance, to view data owned by an application or
to pass a map into a device kernel), give it an ``axom::ArrayView`` indirection via ``policies::ArrayViewIndirection``.

It is declared as:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_map_variables_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_map_variables_end
   :language: C++


Constructing the mesh
=====================

This example uses a very simple fixed mesh, which is assumed to not change after it has been initialized.

Sets
----

The sets are created using a constructor that takes the number of elements.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_construct_sets_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_construct_sets_end
   :language: C++

The values of the vertex indices range from ``0`` to ``verts.size()-1`` (and similarly for ``elems``).

.. note:: All sets, relations and maps in Slam have internal validity checks using
   the ``isValid()`` function:

   .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
      :start-after: _quadmesh_example_set_isvalid_start
      :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_set_isvalid_end
      :language: C++


Relations
---------

The relations are constructed by binding their associated sets and buffers of connectivity data.
We use the ``slam::make_*_relation`` helper functions, which deduce the relation type from their arguments (including the ``axom::Array`` buffers) and return a ready-to-use relation.

We construct the boundary relation from its two sets 
(``elems`` as its ``fromSet`` and ``verts`` as its ``toSet``)
and the array of vertex indices:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_construct_bdry_relation_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_construct_bdry_relation_end
   :language: C++

The coboundary relation requires an additional array of offsets (``begins``)
to indicate the starting index in the relation for each vertex:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_construct_cobdry_relation_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_construct_cobdry_relation_end
   :language: C++


Since these are static relations, they refer to data that was constructed elsewhere
(the ``axom::Array`` buffers, which must outlive the relations).
The relations are lightweight views over that data, and no data is copied. To iteratively
build relations instead, we would use the ``DynamicConstantRelation`` and
``DynamicVariableRelation`` classes.

The ``make_*`` helpers wrap Slam's lower-level ``Builder`` classes; see :ref:`setup-label`
for more details about constructing sets, relations and maps directly.

Maps
----

We define the positions of the mesh vertices as a ``Map`` on the ``verts`` set.
For this example, we set the first vertex to lie at the origin,
and the remaining vertices line within an annulus around the unit circle.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_vert_positions_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_vert_positions_end
   :language: C++


Traversing the mesh
===================

Now that we've constructed the mesh, we can start traversing the mesh connectivity and attaching more fields.

Computing a derived field
-------------------------

Our first traversal loops through the vertices and computes a derived field on the position map.
For each vertex, we compute its distance to the origin.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_vert_distances_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_vert_distances_end
   :language: C++

Computing element centroids
---------------------------

Our next example uses element-to-vertex boundary relation to compute the
*centroids* of each element as the average of its vertex positions.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_elem_centroids_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_elem_centroids_end
   :language: C++

Perhaps the most interesting line here is when we call the relation's subscript operator (``bdry[eID]``).
This function takes an element index (``eID``) and returns the *set* of vertices that are incident in this element.
As such, we can use all functions in the Set API on this return type, e.g. ``size()`` and the subscript operator.

Outputting mesh to disk
-----------------------

As a final example, we highlight several different ways to iterate through the mesh's Sets, Relations and Maps
as we output the mesh to disk (in the ``vtk`` format).

This is a longer example, but the callouts (left-aligned comments 
of the form  ``// <-- message`` ) point to different iteration patterns.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/UserDocs.cpp
   :start-after: _quadmesh_example_output_vtk_start
   :end-before:  _quadmesh_example_output_vtk_end
   :language: C++
