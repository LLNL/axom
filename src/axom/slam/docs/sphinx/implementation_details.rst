Policy-based design
===================

Handling the combinatorial explosion of features; avoid paying for what we don't need

* SizePolicy, StridePolicy, OffsetPolicy (compile time vs. runtime)
* IndirectionPolicy (none, C-array, std::vector, custom, e.g. mfem::Array)
* SubsettingPolicy (none, virtual parent, concrete parent)
* OwnershipPolicy (local, sidre, other repository)

The figure shows how certain these policies interact with the subscript operator.


.. _setup-label:

Simplifying mesh setup
======================

* Builder classes
    * Chained initialization using named-parameter idiom
* Generator classes to simplify types
