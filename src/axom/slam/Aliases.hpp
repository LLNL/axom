 * \file Aliases.hpp
 *
 * \brief Convenience aliases for Slam's most common set and relation configurations.
 *
 * Slam's sets, relations and maps are assembled from policy template parameters
 * (cardinality, stride, indirection, offset, size, subsetting, interface).
 * This lets users customize data structure to their required data model,
 * avoiding unnecessary computational and memory overhead.
 * See the Slam user guide for how to choose policies.
 *
 * A handful of \e relations are commonly used, warranting named shorthands.
 * The aliases in this file for the  common relation types, as well as some set types
 * use `axom::Array` for storage the object manages itself and `axom::ArrayView` for
 * storage managed elsewhere:
 *
 *   - \c RangeSet<P,E>                -- a contiguous range of positions (from RangeSet.hpp)
 *   - \c ArraySet<P,E>                -- a set indexed through an \c axom::Array it manages
 *   - \c ArrayViewSet<P,E>            -- a set indexed through an \c axom::ArrayView managed elsewhere
 *   - \c VariableRelation<F,T>        -- a static relation with variable cardinality, managing its buffers
 *   - \c VariableRelationView<F,T>    -- as above, viewing buffers managed elsewhere
 *   - \c ConstantRelation<F,T,N>      -- a static relation with compile-time cardinality N, managing its buffer
 *   - \c ConstantRelationView<F,T,N>  -- as above, viewing a buffer managed elsewhere
 *   - \c RuntimeConstantRelation<F,T> -- a static relation with runtime-constant cardinality, managing its buffer
 *   - \c RuntimeConstantRelationView<F,T> -- as above, viewing a buffer managed elsewhere
 *
 * These aliases are a convenience for the commonly used configurations.
 * Use the underlying policies directly whenever you need other configuration,
 * e.g. -- a specific stride, offset, size, subsetting or interface, a specialized cardinality such as
 * \c policies::MappedVariableCardinality, or a different buffer such as \c std::vector
 * (\c policies::STLVectorIndirection) or a raw pointer (\c policies::CArrayIndirection).
 *
 * \note This file does not currently alias map types.  A \c Map or \c BivariateMap already
 *  defaults to the common case of `axom::Array` indirection with stride one,
 *  while cases that do vary the map (a view into an externally-managed buffer,
 *  or a runtime stride) also tend to vary in ways a small fixed set of names cannot capture cleanly.
 *
 * \note "Manages its buffer" vs. "views a buffer" refers to lifetime, not to whether
 *  the data is logically owned by the object. An \c axom::Array indirection allocates
 *  and frees the buffer as part of the Slam object's lifetime, while an \c axom::ArrayView
 *  indirection refers to a buffer whose lifetime is managed elsewhere and must outlive the Slam object.
