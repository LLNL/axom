/**
 * \file InterfacePolicies.hpp
 *
 * \brief Interface policies for SLAM
 *
 * Interface policies, when used to instantiate supported SLAM types, allow for
 * selecting between a virtual interface or a concrete interface.
 *
 * Using a virtual interface has the advantage of being able to switch at
 * runtime between different types that correspond to the same base interface.
 * However, there may be some disadvantages:
 *  * Virtual function calls may be slower, if performance is a concern.
 *  * For CUDA/HIP code, virtual SLAM objects cannot cross a host/device
 *    boundary, since the virtual function table is only correct for either the
 *    host or the device, depending on where the object was constructed.
 *
 * Using a concrete interface trades the convenience of runtime polymorphism
 * for improved performance by avoiding virtual function calls. For CUDA/HIP
 * code, SLAM types instantiated with a concrete interface are usually able to
 * cross a host/device boundary, i.e. when captured in a RAJA lambda-based loop.
 *
