MIR User Documentation
=======================

Axom's Material Interface Reconstruction (MIR) component provides algorithms for
reconstructing the interfaces between different materials in multimaterial
meshes. The algorithms take Blueprint meshes
containing a coordset, topology, and matset as input and they output a new Blueprint
node with a new coordset, topology, and matset that contains at most 1 material per zone.

The MIR component also contains some useful components that can be used to develop
other algorithms that process Blueprint meshes.
