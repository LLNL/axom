Partial TODO list

1. view tests
(done) 2. Conduit routine for moving data to the GPU
(done) 3. Build/run on the GPU
4. More ClipField tests (for other topologies) with baselines
   - uniform2d (done)
   - uniform3d
   - rectilinear2d
   - rectilinear3d
   - structured2d
   - structured3d
   - stridedstructured2d
   - stridedstructured3d
   - unstructured2d
     - tri
     - quad
     - mixed
   - unstructured3d
     - tet (done)
     - pyramid (done)
     - wedge (done)
     - hex (done)
     - mixed
   - Test with the various extraction options
   - Test setting the topo, coordset names
   - Test storing results in same Node, use names/fields map to change names
(done)5. Create UnstructuredTopologyMixedShapeView and dispatch
(done)6. Make sure ClipFilter can use the mixed topology view - it probably needs some changes
(done)7. Code cleanup pass in ClipFilter
(done)   - Make sure array view data types are consistent, change to IndexType as needed.
(done)   - Make sure views have "View" in the name.
(done)   - Consolidate some arrays in structs to make passing data to methods easier
(done)   - Split the stages into methods
(done)8. Write a multi-domain, dispatch-based ClipFilter that follows what the original EquiZAlgorithm was doing.
(done)8. Make routine for making a volfrac field from a matset.
(done)9. Create EquiZ implementation
10. Write EquiZ tests
11. Create ELVIRA MIR
12. Create routines that take 2 meshes, do MIR on mesh1, and then intersect mesh1 MIR'd geometry with the mesh2 and compute VF fields
13. Create axom abstractions for RAJA reductions, write serial non-RAJA implementation too
14. Create axom abstractions for RAJA sorts, write serial non-RAJA implementation too
15. Create axom abstractions for RAJA scans, write serial non-RAJA implementation too
16. Go back and use axom/RAJA abstractions
17. Revisit NodeArrayView code with interleaved data - make the right views.
18. [lower priority] Revisit NodeArrayView and constness/references.
19. [lower priority] Can ClipField be generalized a little into something like TopologyExtractor? Then use it to make other filters?
(done)20. [lower priority] ConduitAllocateThroughAxom uses statics. I'd prefer to template it on ExecSpace and make the allocator a member but Conduit's API does not let us pass a void* to the allocation callbacks.
(done)21. Check the edge definitions in pyr, wedge Shape types.
22. Compile for all compute back-ends and make sure tests run/pass.
    - Right now, OMP causes the compiler to crash when linking
23. Make some timing tests so we can see how Clipfield/MIR do at various mesh sizes.
24. Make example showing how to use MIR
25. Make utility that can load data from MFEM/Blueprint/Silo into blueprint, do MIR, and save out results.
26. Make sure OMP/HIP performance are good
27. Make sure it builds using CUDA
